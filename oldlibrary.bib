abstract = {We model the triplet-triplet energy-transfer experiments from the Closs group [ Closs , G. L. ; et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988 , 110 , 2652. ] using a combination of Marcus theory and either Boys or Edmiston-Ruedenberg localized diabatization, and we show that relative and absolute rates of electronic excitation transfer may be computed successfully. For the case where both the donor and acceptor occupy equatorial positions on a rigid cyclohexane bridge, we find beta(calc) = 2.8 per C-C bond, compared with the experimental value beta(exp) = 2.6. This work highlights the power of using localized diabatization methods as a tool for modeling nonequilibrium processes.},

abstract = {A remarkable amount of theoretical research has been carried out to elucidate the physical origins of the recently observed long-lived quantum coherence in the electronic energy transfer process in biological photosynthetic systems. Although successful in many respects, several widely used descriptions only include an effective treatment of the protein-chromophore interactions. In this work, by combining an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation, time-dependent density functional theory, and open quantum system approaches, we successfully simulate the dynamics of the electronic energy transfer of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson pigment-protein complex. The resulting characteristic beating of populations and quantum coherences is in good agreement with the experimental results and the hierarchy equation of motion approach. The experimental absorption, linear, and circular dichroism spectra and dephasing rates are recovered at two different temperatures. In addition, we provide an extension of our method to include zero-point fluctuations of the vibrational environment. This work thus presents, to our knowledge, one of the first steps to explain the role of excitonic quantum coherence in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes based on their atomistic and molecular description.},

@article{Djebaili2013,
abstract = {Here, the adsorption of alkanethiols (from ethane to dodecanethiol) on icosahedral gold nanocrystals with diameters up to 10 nm is studied by molecular dynamics simulations in a vacuum. The surface coverage of the nanocrystals obtained in the simulations is in good agreement with experimental data. We show that the average surface per adsorbed thiol does not markedly depend on the nanocrystal size and ligand and is only about 10\% lower than the value observed on a flat Au(111) surface. We observe two different molecular organizations of the thiolates on the edges and in the centers of the nanocrystal facets. The incompatibility between both organizations explains the fact that the formation of self-assembled monolayers usually observed on flat Au(111) surfaces is hindered for nanocrystals smaller than 6 nm. We also show that the organization of thiolates on the edges is at the origin of the lower average surface per adsorbed thiol found for the nanocrystal.},

abstract = {Embedded density functional theory (e-DFT) is used to describe the electronic structure of strongly interacting molecular subsystems. We present a general implementation of the Exact Embedding (EE) method [J. Chem. Phys. 133, 084103 (2010)] to calculate the large contributions of the nonadditive kinetic potential (NAKP) in such applications. Potential energy curves are computed for the dissociation of Li(+)-Be, CH(3)-CF(3), and hydrogen-bonded water clusters, and e-DFT results obtained using the EE method are compared with those obtained using approximate kinetic energy functionals. In all cases, the EE method preserves excellent agreement with reference Kohn-Sham calculations, whereas the approximate functionals lead to qualitative failures in the calculated energies and equilibrium structures. We also demonstrate an accurate pairwise approximation to the NAKP that allows for efficient parallelization of the EE method in large systems; benchmark calculations on molecular crystals reveal ideal, size-independent scaling of wall-clock time with increasing system size.},

@article{Olbrich2011a,
abstract = {The experimental observation of long-lived quantum coherences in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) light-harvesting complex at low temperatures has challenged general intuition in the field of complex molecular systems and provoked considerable theoretical effort in search of explanations. Here we report on room-temperature calculations of the excited-state dynamics in FMO using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure calculations. Thus we obtain trajectories for the Hamiltonian of this system which contains time-dependent vertical excitation energies of the individual bacteriochlorophyll molecules and their mutual electronic couplings. The distribution of energies and couplings is analyzed together with possible spatial correlations. It is found that in contrast to frequent assumptions the site energy distribution is non-Gaussian. In a subsequent step, averaged wave packet dynamics is used to determine the exciton dynamics in the system. Finally, with the time-dependent Hamiltonian, linear and two-dimensional spectra are determined. The thus-obtained linear absorption line shape agrees well with experimental observation and is largely determined by the non-Gaussian site energy distribution. The two-dimensional spectra are in line with what one would expect by extrapolation of the experimental observations at lower temperatures and indicate almost total loss of long-lived coherences.},

@article{Prezhdo2009,
abstract = {Nanoscale clusters of bulk materials, also known as quantum dots (QDs), exhibit both molecular and bulk properties. Unlike either bulk or molecular materials, QD properties can be modified continuously by changing QD shape and size. However, the chemical and physical properties of molecular and bulk materials often contradict each other, which can lead to differing viewpoints about the behavior of QDs. For example, the molecular view suggests strong electron-hole and charge-phonon interactions, as well as slow energy relaxation due to mismatch between electronic energy gaps and phonon frequencies. In contrast, the bulk view advocates that the kinetic energy of quantum confinement is greater than electron-hole interactions, that charge-phonon coupling is weak, and that the relaxation through quasi-continuous bands is rapid. By synthesizing the bulk and molecular viewpoints, this Account clarifies the controversies and provides a unified atomistic picture of the nature and dynamics of photoexcited states in semiconductor QDs. Based on the state-of-the-art ab initio approaches in both the energy and time domains, the Account presents a comprehensive discussion of the dynamical processes in QDs, ranging from the initial photon absorption to the final emission. The atomistic description of QDs complements phenomenological models, provides important details, and creates new scientific paradigms. The ab initio approaches are particularly useful for studying geometric and electronic structure of QDs because they treat bulk, surface, ligands, and defects on equal footing and incorporate electronic correlation effects. Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations most closely mimic the complex coupled evolutions of charges, phonons, and spins as they occur in nature. The simulations show that the underlying atomic structure, thermal fluctuations, and surface effects lift electronic state degeneracies predicted by phenomenological models and that excitonic electron-hole interactions are strong in small QDs. Stoichiometric surfaces self-heal. However, only molecular ligands and core/shell designs can eliminate traps associated with dangling chemical bonds, missing atoms, and other defects. Ligands create charge traps and provide high-frequency phonons. The phonon-induced dephasing of electronic excitations is ultrafast, ranging from tens to hundreds of femtoseconds. The dependence of the relaxation on the excitation energy and the density of states clarify the controversies regarding the phonon bottleneck in the photoexcited electron relaxation, and the participation of low-frequency phonons explains the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate. We rationalize the ultrafast generation of multiple excitons without the phononbottleneck by strong Coulomb interactions between the charge carriers. The QD charging and defects explain the large variation in the experimental data on multiple exciton generation. The issues raised here with the electronic states and semiconductor QDs are similar to those found with the spin states and metallic QDs. Assemblies of QDs with other materials, such as organic chromophores and inorganic semiconductors, will present new sets of questions. Time-domain ab initio approaches will allow scientists to address these challenges directly in the near future.},

@article{Krueger1998,
abstract = {A practical method for accurate evaluation of the Coulombic contribution to the electronic coupling for energy transfer at any donor−acceptor separation is reported. The method involves the exact interaction between transition densities of each chromophore which are calculated ab initio and may include electron correlation. The method is used to calculate coupling strengths between the pigments of the bacterial light-harvesting complex, LH2, and to compare with results using the ideal dipole approximation (IDA). The results suggest that the relatively symmetric transitions of bacteriochlorophyll a (Bchla) pigments are reasonably well described by the IDA for separations >15 \AA, although deviations are significant at smaller separations. The less symmetric transition of the twisted carotenoid pigment is rather poorly described by the IDA and shows significant deviation even at separations of well over 20 \AA. The calculated coupling strengths are combined with estimates of the spectral overlap integral to estimate energy-transfer rates and time scales. The total depopulation time scale of the carotenoid S2 state is estimated to be 85 fs, in reasonable agreement with experiment. The B800−B850 transfer time is estimated to be 1.3 ps (a factor of 2 slower than experiment). Rapid (<400 fs) B800−B800 energy transfer is also predicted. Moreover, the calculations suggest that energy flows both from the carotenoid and the B800 Bchla into pigments of several different protomer units, indicating that interaction between protomer units is important in the LH2 function.},

The metallo-derivatives include Zn(II), Cu(II), Ni(II), and Pd(II). For the TiO2−porphyrin assemblies, electron injection from the photoexcited dye to the semiconductor occurs only when using the zinc derivative as the sensitizer because it is the only dye studied in this report with long-lived excited states higher in energy than the TiO2 conduction band edge. All of the dyes, however, have excited-state energies above the SnO2 conduction band edge, and the electron injection rates vary widely from 0.4 to 200 ps depending on the sensitizer. For the SnO2−porphyrin assemblies, electron injection is strongly influenced by competition with alternate deactivation routes that are accessible following Soret band excitation. These results offer thermodynamic and kinetic considerations for designing improved high-potential porphyrin photoanodes with applications to solar-powered water oxidation.},

abstract = {This Article reports measurements of the intra- and intermolecular ordering of tight-binding octylphosphonate ligands on the surface of colloidal CdSe quantum dots (QDs) within solid state films, and the dependence of this order on the size of the QDs. The order of the organic ligands, as probed by vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, decreases as the radius of the QDs decreases; this decrease is correlated with a decrease in the order of underlying Cd(2+), as detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) line width measurements, for radii of the QDs, R > 2.4 nm, and is independent of the disorder of the Cd(2+) for R < 2.4 nm. We believe that, for R < 2.4, the decreasing order of the ligands with decreasing size is due to an increase in the curvature of the QD surfaces. Disorder in the Cd(2+) results from the presence of a shell of Cd(2+)-surfactant complexes that form during synthesis, so this work demonstrates the possibility for chemical control over molecular order within films of colloidal QDs by changing the surfactant mixture.},

abstract = {Chemical reductants of sub-conduction-band potentials are demonstrated to induce large photoluminescence enhancement in colloidal ZnSe-based nanocrystals. The photoluminescence quantum yield of colloidal Mn(2+)-doped ZnSe nanocrystals has been improved from 14\% to 80\% simply by addition of an outer-sphere reductant. Up to 48-fold redox brightening is observed for nanocrystals with lower starting quantum yields. These increases are quickly reversed upon exposure to air and are temporary even under anaerobic conditions. This redox brightening process offers a new and systematic approach to understanding redox-active surface "trap states" and their contributions to the physical properties of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals.},

abstract = {Understanding the pathways of hot exciton relaxation in photoexcited semiconductor nanocrystals, also called quantum dots (QDs), is of paramount importance in multiple energy, electronics and biological applications. An important nonradiative relaxation channel originates from the nonadiabatic (NA) coupling of electronic degrees of freedom to nuclear vibrations, which in QDs depend on the confinement effects and complicated surface chemistry. To elucidate the role of surface ligands in relaxation processes of nanocrystals, we study the dynamics of the NA exciton relaxation in Cd(33)Se(33) semiconductor quantum dots passivated by either trimethylphosphine oxide or methylamine ligands using explicit time-dependent modeling. The large extent of hybridization between electronic states of quantum dot and ligand molecules is found to strongly facilitate exciton relaxation. Our computational results for the ligand contributions to the exciton relaxation and electronic energy-loss in small clusters are further extrapolated to larger quantum dots.},

@article{Liang1992,
abstract = {Effective transfer integrals (r) have been evaluated for u- and n-type electron and hole transfer in radical ion systems comprising methylene donor/acceptor groups linked by various saturated organic spacer groups. The T values have been calculated on the basis of ab initio self-consistent-field wave functions for the radical ion states, obtained either directly for the system of interest ( TwF) or from the associated neutral state via Koopmans’ theorem (TKT), and employing either minimal (STO-3G) or split-valence (3-21G) basis sets. The TKT values have been decomposed into additive contributions from individual pathways, both through-space (Ti;) and through-bond (Ti:), using perturbation theory as formulated by Ratner together with a localized orbital basis represented by natural bond orbitals (NBO’s) as defined by Weinhold et al. The overall coupling has been shown to arise from interference among a large number of competing pathways, none of which is strongly dominant. Nearest-neighbor pathways of the McConnell type are significant for transfer in some radical cation systems, but are frequently of very minor significance in comparison with lower-order superexchange pathways, often with contributions differing in sign from the overall TKT values. These latter conclusions are generally consistent with those based on studies involving different saturated spacer groups by Naleway et al. (for radical anions) and Jordan and Paddon-Row (for radical anions and cations). We find that transfer in radical anions and cations is generally dominated, respectively, by “electron” and ”hole” pathways, but both mechanisms are found to be significant in both types of transfer. A number of transferability relationships have been identified for generic pathway types, and the important influence of stereochemistry on coupling has been illustrated, with regard to both orientation of donor/acceptor groups relative to the spacer and internal conformation of the spacer, showing the competition between coupling via the carbon framework and via CH bonds (i.e., hyperconjugation).},

Clearly resolved excited state absorption features are observed to beat at the frequency of the longitudinal-optical phonon, and the phase of this beating is found to be polarization-dependent. A simulation is performed using the excitonic and biexcitionic fine structure states predicted by theory, and the polarization-dependent beating allows each feature to be assigned to a particular excited state absorption pathway. Owing to their circularly polarized selection rules, the polarization-dependent 2DPE technique provides valuable insights into the spectroscopy of quantum dots. In particular, transient absorption features observed in pump-probe studies of CdSe quantum dots can now be assigned to specific fine structure transitions to the ground state biexciton.},

We review the key advantages of using quantum dots (QDs) in display and lighting applications, including their color purity, solution processability, and stability. After highlighting the main developments in QD-LED technology in the past 15 years, we describe the three mechanisms for exciting QDs - optical excitation, F\"{o}rster energy transfer, and direct charge injection - that have been leveraged to create QD-LEDs. We outline the challenges facing QD-LED development, such as QD charging and QD luminescence quenching in QD thin films. We describe how optical downconversion schemes have enabled researchers to overcome these challenges and develop commercial lighting products that incorporate QDs to achieve desirable color temperature and a high CRI while maintaining efficiencies comparable to inorganic white LEDs (>65 lumens per Watt). We conclude by discussing some current directions in QD research that focus on achieving higher efficiency and air-stable QD-LEDs using electrical excitation of the luminescent QDs.},

abstract = {In this paper we explore the energetic control of sequential and superexchange electron transfer (ET) mechanisms on the basis of quantum-mechanical simulations and calculations for long-range ET in DBA systems, where the donor (D) and the acceptor (A) are separated by a bridge (B). We studied ET dynamics in a Franck–Condon (FC) system characterized by three multi-dimensional displaced harmonic potential surfaces, where an initial single vibronic doorway state ∣$\alpha$〉 (with energy E$\alpha$) in the DBA (≡D) electronic state is coupled to the mediating \{∣$\beta$〉\} vibronic quasicontinuum of the D+B−A (≡B) electronic state, which in turn is coupled to the final \{∣$\gamma$〉\} vibronic quasicontinuum of the D+BA− (≡A) electronic state. The level structure was described by the vibrational frequencies (for a four-mode harmonic system) and the energy gaps $\Delta$GDB and $\Delta$GDA between the origins of the corresponding electronic states (with n$\alpha$ = 1–50, n$\beta$ = 1000–2000, and n$\gamma$ = 1000–2000 states in the \{∣$\alpha$〉\}, \{∣$\beta$〉\}, and \{∣$\gamma$〉\} manifolds, respectively), while the couplings were characterized by the spectral densities and by the pair correlations (specified in terms of correlation parameters $\eta$$\alpha$$\alpha$′ and $\eta$$\beta$$\beta$′) between states belonging to the same manifold. The correlation parameters $\eta$$\alpha$$\alpha$′ ($\alpha$,$\alpha$′=1–40) for the doorway-quasicontinuum coupling and $\eta$$\beta$$\beta$′ ($\beta$,$\beta$′=150–190) for the interquasicontinuum coupling are considerably lower than unity (∣$\eta$$\alpha$$\alpha$′∣ ⩽ 0.4 and ∣$\eta$$\beta$$\beta$′∣ ⩽ 0.3), obeying propensity rules with the highest values of ∣$\eta$$\alpha$$\alpha$′∣ and ∣$\eta$$\beta$$\beta$′∣ which correspond to a single vibrational quantum difference, while for multimode changes between $\alpha$ and $\alpha$′ or between $\beta$ and $\beta$′ very low values of ∣$\eta$$\alpha$$\alpha$′∣ or ∣$\eta$$\beta$$\beta$′∣ are exhibited. Radiationless transitions theory was applied for quantum-mechanical simulations based on the dynamcis of wave packets of molecular eigenstates for resonance ($\Delta$GDB<E$\alpha$) and for off-resonance ($\Delta$GDB>E$\alpha$) coupling. Resonance ∣$\alpha$〉–\{∣$\beta$〉\}–\{∣$\gamma$〉\} coupling results in two-step sequential ET kinetics for all doorway states ∣$\alpha$〉, manifesting phase erosion due to weakly correlated intercontinuum coupling, without the need of intermediate state phonon induced thermalization. Off-resonance ∣$\alpha$〉–\{∣$\beta$〉\} coupling in conjunction with \{∣$\beta$〉\}–\{∣$\gamma$〉\} resonance interactions results in unistep superexchange ET kinetics. The simulated sequential ET rates and the superexchange rate are in good agreement with the calculated quantum-mechanical rates obtained using the electronic couplings and FC densities. The energy-gap ($\Delta$GDB) dependence of the simulated and the calculated ET rates from a single doorway state reveal a “transition” from sequential to superexchange ET with increasing $\Delta$GDB. For a finite-temperature system, characterized by a fixed $\Delta$GDB (>0) small energy gap, the thermally averaged rate from a canonical ensemble of doorway states will result in the superposition of both superexchange and sequential mechanisms.},

In addition to exploring the controllability of adsorbed molecules by moderately intense laser fields and discussing the fundamental differences of alignment behavior between surface-adsorbed molecules and gas phase molecules, we computationally investigate the quality of orientation with respect to field intensity, field duration, and the location of the tip. Overall, the molecule moves directly to its oriented configuration, which is reasonably insensitive to the tip location.

abstract = {We report on coherent emission of the neutral exciton state in a single semiconductor self-assembled InAs=GaAs quantum dot embedded in a one-dimensional waveguide, under resonant picosecond pulsed excitation. Direct measurements of the radiative lifetime and coherence time are performed as a function of excitation power and temperature. The characteristic damping of Rabi oscillations observed is attributed to an excitation-induced dephasing due to a resonant coupling between the emitter and the acoustic phonon bath of the matrix. Other sources responsible for the decrease of the coherence time have been evidenced, in particular an enhancement of the radiative recombination rate due to the resonant strong coupling between the dot and the one-dimensional optical mode. As a consequence, the emission couples very efficiently into the waveguide mode, leading to an additional relaxation term of the excited- state population. DOI:},

@article{Harel2011,
abstract = {Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2D ES) maps the electronic structure of complex systems on a femtosecond time scale. While analogous to multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, 2D optical spectroscopy differs significantly in its implementation. Yet, 2D Fourier spectroscopies still require point-by-point sampling of the time delay between two pulses responsible for creating quantum coherence among states. Unlike NMR, achieving the requisite phase stability at optical frequencies between these pulse pairs remains experimentally challenging. Nonetheless, 2D optical spectroscopy has been successfully demonstrated by combining passive and active phase stabilization along with precise control of optical delays and long-term temperature stability, although the widespread adoption of 2D ES has been significantly hampered by these technical challenges. Here, we exploit an analogy to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to demonstrate a single-shot method capable of acquiring the entire 2D spectrum in a single laser shot using only conventional optics. Unlike point-by-point sampling protocols typically used to record 2D spectra, this method, which we call GRadient-Assisted Photon Echo (GRAPE) spectroscopy, largely eliminates phase errors while reducing the acquisition time by orders of magnitude. By incorporating a spatiotemporal encoding of the nonlinear polarization along the excitation frequency axis of the 2D spectrum, GRAPE spectroscopy achieves no loss in signal while simultaneously reducing overall noise. Here, we describe the principles of GRAPE spectroscopy and discuss associated experimental considerations.},

abstract = {The dynamics of heterogeneous electron transfer (ET) from the polycyclic aromatic chromophore perylene to nanostructured TiO2 anatase was investigated for two different anchor groups with transient absorption spectroscopy in an ultrahigh vacuum. Data from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and from linear absorption spectroscopy showed that the donor state of the chromophore was located around 900 meV above the lower edge of the conduction band. With the wide band limit fulfilled the rate of the heterogeneous ET reaction was only controlled by the strength of the electronic coupling and not reduced by Franck-Condon factors. Two different time constants for the electron transfer, i.e., 13 and 28 fs, were measured with carboxylic acid and phosphonic acid as the respective anchor groups. The difference in the ET time constants was explained with the different extension of the donor orbital onto the respective anchor group to reach the empty electronic states of the semiconductor. The time constants were extracted by means of a simple rate equation model. The validity of applying this model on this ultrafast time scale was verified by comparing the rate equation model with an optical Bloch equation model.},

These auxiliary bases are slightly more than three times larger than orbital bases of split valence quality.

Full geometry optimization and extensive searches of the potential energy surface were carried out for clusters with n = 1-6. We find that even small PbS clusters (n > 2) start to take on the characteristic features of the rock salt structure of solid-state PbS (galena). The origin of some of the structural aspects of these crystals is shown to be associated with the partial covalent nature of the Pb-S bond. The magnitude of the HOMO-LUMO gap oscillates with increasing size of the clusters, in agreement with the observed behavior of the corresponding UV absorption bands of ultrasmall PbS quantum dots. Direct conformation of this oscillation was found by CIS(D) calculations, for which the absorption with the largest oscillator strength oscillates as the clusters grow from PbS to (PbS)9.},

To contribute to this debate we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the coupling between the protein environment and the vertical excitation energies of individual bacteriochlorophyll molecules in the FMO complex of the green sulphur bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum. The so-called spectral densities, which account for the environmental influence on the excited state dynamics, are determined from temporal autocorrelation functions of the energy gaps between ground and first excited states of the individual pigments. Although the overall shape of the spectral density is found to be rather similar for all pigments, variations in their magnitude can be seen. Differences between the spectral densities for the pigments of the FMO monomer and FMO trimer are also presented.},

A low-frequency, polarized laser field is used to switch the system by orienting the molecule with the field polarization axis, enabling conductance through the junction. Enhancement and spatial localization of the incident field by the metallic tip allow operation at low intensities.

Our model Hamiltonian accounts for coupling to solvent and vibrational modes, and describes both elastic and inelastic processes. For the case of elastic transitions, we derive an explicit formula for the current that also includes the effect of an overlap between the solvation spheres of the two bridge states. For inelastic transitions we treat the case where one quantum mode interacts with one of the two bridge states; model calculations for the current as a function of the bias show a characteristic rise in the current whenever a new inelastic channel is opened. The system may show several features desirable for molecular electronics: rectification, negative differential resistance, and triode characteristics.},

Our study shows that resonant excitation of ZnSe tips results in an unprecedently fast transfer of excited electrons into CdS domains of nanobarbells (<0.35 ps), whereas selective pumping of CdS components leads to a relatively slow injection of photoinduced holes into ZnSe tips (tau(h)= 95 ps). A qualitative thermodynamic description of observed electron processes within the classical limit of Marcus theory was used to identify a specific charge transfer regime associated with the ultrafast electron injection into CdS. Potential photocatalytic applications of the observed fast separation of carriers along the main axis of ZnSe/CdS barbells are discussed.},

A theory for modelling these dynamics is next formulated within a time-dependent scattering approach. Our end result provides useful insight into the system properties that determine the reaction outcome as well as a computationally convenient framework for numerical realization. The theory is applied to study single-molecule surface reactions induced by a scanning tunnelling microscope and current-triggered dynamics in single-molecule transistors.

This is obtained by introducing proper solvent-specific operators in the Kohn-Sham equations and in the corresponding TD scheme. The solvation model exploits the integral equation formalism (IEF) version of PCM and it defines the solvent operators on a molecular cavity modeled on the real three-dimensional (3D) structure of the solute systems.

The formulation is used to predict 2J for the photophysically well-characterized series phenothiazine-p-(phenylene)n-perylene diimide, n = 2,3,4,5, where the superexchange coupling is calculated with multipathway, second- and third-order perturbation theory coupled with the extended Huckel formalism. U and epsilon are estimated through experimentally determined electrochemical potentials. Due to multiple interactions arising from the large distance between magnetic centers in these donor-bridge-acceptor systems, agreement with experiment was substantially improved when third-order corrections were included in the calculation of t and 2J.},

This work is an extension of the earlier developed LPNO coupled-electron pair approximation LNPO-CEPA method F. Neese et al., Chem. Phys. 130, 114108 2009 and makes extended use of the resolution of the identity RI or density fitting DF approximation. Two variants of each method are compared. The less accurate approximations LPNO2-QCISD/LPNO2-CCSD still recover 98.7\%–99.3\% of the correlation energy in the given basis and have modest disk space requirements. The more accurate variants LPNO1-QCISD/LPNO1-CCSD typically recover 99.75\%–99.95\% of the correlation energy in the given basis but require the Coulomb and exchange operators with up to two-external indices to be stored on disk. Both variants have comparable computational efficiency. The convergence of the results with respect to the natural orbital truncation parameter TCutPNO has been studied. Extended numerical tests have been performed on absolute and relative correlation energies as function of basis set size and TCutPNO as well as on reaction energies, isomerization energies, and weak intermolecular interactions. The results indicate that the errors of the LPNO methods compared to the canonical QCISD and CCSD methods are below 1 kcal/mol with our default thresholds. Finally, some calculations on larger molecules are reported ranging from 40–86 atoms and it is shown that for medium sized molecules the total wall clock time required to complete the LPNO-CCSD calculations is only two to four times that of the preceding self-consistent field SCF. Thus these methods are highly suitable for large-scale computational chemistry applications. Since there are only three thresholds involved that have been given conservative default values, the methods can be confidentially used in a “black-box” fashion in the same way as their canonical counterparts.},

A ligand shell made of a combination of trioctylphosphine (TOP), oleylamine (OA), and stearic acid (SA) stabilizes the as- synthesized QDs. The composition of the shell was analyzed and quantified using high resolution liquid state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A quenching of the fluorescence of the QDs is observed upon removal of the ligands by diluting the stock solution of the QDs. The fluorescence is restored by the addition of TOP. We analyze the results by assuming a binomial distribution of quenchers among the QDs and predict a linear trend in the time-resolved fluorescence decays.We have used a nonparametric analysis to show that for our QDs, 3.0(0.1 quenching sites per QD on average are revealed by the removal of TOP. We moreover show that the quenching rates of the quenching sites add up. The decay per quenching site can be compared with the decay at saturation of the dilution effect. This provides a value of 2.88 (0.02 for the number of quenchers per QD. We extract the quenching dynamics of one site. It appears to be a process with a distribution of rates that does not involve the ligands.},

Specifically, we explore the properties of the channel phase, an observable of energy-domain two-pathway excitation experiments that was shown in the isolated molecule limit to carry information about the phase properties of the material system. Our analysis is based on the combination of steady state and time-dependent analytical perturbative approaches within the density matrix formalism, complemented by nonperturbative numerical simulations. We find that the channel phase carries significantly richer information in the presence of decoherence mechanisms than in their absence. In particular, rescattering events in the structured continuum introduce new features in the channel phase spectrum, whose structure conveys information about both the molecular continuum and the system bath interaction.},

@article{Jorn2010a,
abstract = {Instances of strongly nonadiabatic electronic-vibrational energy transfer have been studied since the early days of quantum mechanics and remain a topic of fundamental interest. Often such transfers are associated with electronic resonances, temporary states where transient localization of charge on the molecule provides a mechanism for channeling electronic energy into vibrational excitation. Extensively studied in the gas phase, electron resonance scattering also occurs with surface adsorbed molecules, where it manifests itself in broadened cross sections and desorption of adsorbates from metal surfaces. In this Account, we focus on a related topic: the implications of nonadiabatic, resonance-mediated scattering to the exciting field of molecular electronics. In this context, researchers can induce directed nuclear dynamics and control these processes in single molecules in contact with metallic and semiconducting electrodes. We discuss a variety of consequences and applications of current-driven nuclear excitation in molecular devices, ranging from the design of new forms of molecular machines to surface chemistry at the single-molecule level and atom-resolved lithography. We highlight two specific examples of molecular nanomachines. In the first, a Au-C(60)-Au transistor, the current induces the oscillatory motion of the center-of-mass coordinate of the C(60). The second, a zwitterion-based rattle, demonstrates excitation of intramolecular motion as the positively charged moiety is threaded back and forth through the negatively charged carbon ring. Finally, we discuss the current-induced desorption of organic molecules from Si(100) both to suggest the potential for controlled surface nanochemistry and to develop guidelines for the design of stable molecular junctions. Modeling the exchange of energy between tunneling electrons and the vibrational degrees of freedom of a target molecule subject to bias voltage, open boundary conditions in the electronic subspace, and the dissipative effects of the electrodes poses a fascinating challenge to contemporary theories of inelastic electron transport. A scattering theory of density matrices is motivated by the need to address large amplitude, chemically relevant dynamics in tandem with an appropriate treatment of the electronic scattering problem. We provide a qualitative discussion of the theory and note the limits in which it reduces to well-known approaches.},

abstract = {Results from quantum chemical INDO/S-CI calculations of the absorption properties of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles sensitized by catechol and benzoic acid are reported. Experimental observations that catechol causes a strong shift in the TiO2 absorption threshold, while benzoic acid does not, are explained from the calculations which indicate that only catechol introduces electronic levels in the TiO2 band gap. The 420 nm excitation in the TiO2 + catechol system responsible for the shift is seen to be a charge-transfer excitation from the catechol $\pi$ HOMO orbital to Ti(3d) levels at the bottom of the conduction band. A direct photoinjection scheme which does not involve excited states of the adsorbate is proposed to account for the electron injection process.},

We have proposed a technique for decomposing the total time-dependent current into almost independent current components. This is a powerful technique for gaining insight into transient current behavior because the decomposed currents exhibit simple behaviors similar to those of single-level systems. We have clarified the transient current behaviors of a hydrogen molecule (two-level system) and an octatetraene molecule (eight-level system) connected to two electrodes as typical examples of multilevel systems. The transient current of the molecular hydrogen system is characterized by two current components with the same relaxation time and different oscillation periods, whereas the current of the octatetraene molecular system is decomposed into eight components, a few of which dominate the total current behavior during the initial stage.},

abstract = {This paper reports control of the competition between step-growth and living chain-growth polymerization mechanisms in the formation of cadmium chalcogenide colloidal quantum dots (QDs) from CdSe(S) clusters by varying the concentration of anionic surfactant in the synthetic reaction mixture. The growth of the particles proceeds by step-addition from initially nucleated clusters in the absence of excess phosphinic or carboxylic acids, which adsorb as their anionic conjugate bases, and proceeds indirectly by dissolution of clusters, and subsequent chain-addition of monomers to stable clusters (Ostwald ripening) in the presence of excess phosphinic or carboxylic acid. Fusion of clusters by step-growth polymerization is an explanation for the consistent observation of so-called "magic-sized" clusters in QD growth reactions. Living chain-addition (chain addition with no explicit termination step) produces QDs over a larger range of sizes with better size dispersity than step-addition. Tuning the molar ratio of surfactant to Se2-(S2-), the limiting ionic reagent, within the living chain-addition polymerization allows for stoichiometric control of QD radius without relying on reaction time.},

We find that the time and energy characteristics of the laser fields that produce desired alignment characteristics at a predetermined instant respond in distinct manners to decoherence and to population relaxation, and are sensitive to both time scales. In particular, the time-evolving spectral composition of the optimal pulse mirrors the time-evolving rotational composition of the wave packet, and points to different mechanisms of rotational excitation in isolated systems, in systems subject to a decoherering bath, and in ones subject to a population relaxing bath.},

abstract = {A new quantum dynamic equation for excitation energy transfer is developed which can describe quantum coherent wavelike motion and incoherent hopping in a unified manner. The developed equation reduces to the conventional Redfield theory and Forster theory in their respective limits of validity. In the regime of coherent wavelike motion, the equation predicts several times longer lifetime of electronic coherence between chromophores than does the conventional Redfield equation. Furthermore, we show quantum coherent motion can be observed even when reorganization energy is large in comparison to intersite electronic coupling (the Forster incoherent regime). In the region of small reorganization energy, slow fluctuation sustains longer-lived coherent oscillation, whereas the Markov approximation in the Redfield framework causes infinitely fast fluctuation and then collapses the quantum coherence. In the region of large reorganization energy, sluggish dissipation of reorganization energy increases the time electronic excitation stays above an energy barrier separating chromophores and thus prolongs delocalization over the chromophores.},

abstract = {The deconvolution of spectroelectrochemical data is often quite difficult if the spectra of intermediates are not known. Factor analysis, however, has been shown to be a powerful technique which can make it possible to deconvolute overlapping spectra. In this work, evolving factor analysis will be used to determine the number of intermediates and the spectra of those species for two typical spectroelectrochemical experiments: linear scan voltammetry and chronoabsorptometry in a thin-layer cell. The first system was the reduction of E. coli sulfite reductase hemoprotein (SiR-HP). Principal factor analysis indicated that three species were present. By using evolving factor analysis, the potential regions where each of the species were present were identified, and their concentrations and spectra were determined by the use of the mass balance equation. The spectra of the one-electron (SiR-HP1-) and two-electron (SiR-HP2-) reduced product were compared with previous work. The second experiment was the chronoabsorptometry of Cl2FeS2MoS2FeCl2(2-) in methylene chloride. This experiment indicated that five species were present during the experiment. The entire set of 61 spectra were fit by assuming that there were 4 species present during the electrolysis. The rate constant for the appearance of subsequent species fit quite well with the rate constant for the disappearance of previous species. The spectra of the intermediates and final product were obtained using evolving factor analysis and a mass balance equation. Identification of the fifth species, which was probably the initial reduction product, Cl2FeS2MoS2FeCl2(3-), was difficult due to its low concentration and the fact that it was present in the same time region as the starting material.},

The method is applied to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein in order to investigate the influence of the different parts of the spectral density as well as correlations among these contributions on the energy transfer dynamics and on the temperature-dependent decay of coherences. The fluctuations and correlations in excitonic couplings as well as the correlations between coupling and site energy fluctuations are found to be 1 order of magnitude smaller in amplitude than the site energy fluctuations. Despite considerable amplitudes of that part of the spectral density which contains correlations in site energy fluctuations, the effect of these correlations on the exciton population dynamics and dephasing of coherences is negligible. The inhomogeneous charge distribution of the protein, which causes variations in local pigment-protein coupling constants of the normal modes, is responsible for this effect. It is seen thereby that the same building principle that is used by nature to create an excitation energy funnel in the FMO protein also allows for efficient dissipation of the excitons' excess energy.},

A fuller understanding of hydrogen in solids is required to support development of improved hydrogen-storage systems, proton-exchange membranes for fuel cells, and high-permittivity dielectrics for integrated circuits. In chemistry and in biological systems, there have also been many efforts to correlate proton affinity and deprotonation with host properties. Here we report a systematic theoretical study (based on ab initio methods) of hydrogen in a wide range of hosts, which reveals the existence of a universal alignment for the electronic transition level of hydrogen in semiconductors, insulators and even aqueous solutions. This alignment allows the prediction of the electrical activity of hydrogen in any host material once some basic information about the band structure of that host is known. We present a physical explanation that connects the behaviour of hydrogen to the line-up of electronic band structures at heterojunctions.},

abstract = {Nanoparticles have been proposed as a promising material for creating devices that harvest, transport, and manipulate energy and electrons. Ultrafast charge carrier dynamics represent a critical design aspect and are dependent on both size and shape of the nanoparticle. Spectroscopic investigation of the electronic structure and dynamics of these systems is complicated by sample inhomogeneity, which broadens peaks and leads to ambiguity in interpretation of both spectra and dynamics. Here, we use two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy to remove inhomogeneous broadening and to clarify interpretation of measured dynamics. We specifically investigate the effect of nanoparticle shape on the electronic structure and ultrafast electronic dynamics in the band-edge exciton states of CdSe quantum dots, nanorods, and nanoplatelets. Particle size was chosen to enable straightforward comparisons of the effects of particle shape on the spectra and dynamics without retuning the laser source. The spectra were measured with low pulse powers (generally <1 nJ/pulse), using short pulses (\~{}12 fs) to minimize interference from solvent contributions to the spectra, ambiguities in the dynamics due to pulse-overlap effects, and contributions to the dynamics from multi-exciton effects. The lowest two exciton states are clearly resolved in spectra of quantum dots but unresolved for nanorods and nanoplates, in agreement with previous spectroscopic and theoretical results. In all nanoparticles, ultrafast dynamics measurements show strong evidence of electronic relaxation into the lowest energy exciton state within \~{}30 fs, a timescale not observable in previous dynamics measurements of similar systems. These dynamics are unambiguously assigned to hole relaxation, as the higher lying electronic excited states are not energetically accessible in these experiments. Clear evidence of coherent superpositions of the lowest two exciton states were not seen in any of the particles studied, in contrast to recent results from work on quantum dots.},

abstract = {Photoinduced electron transfer to TiO2 nanoparticles has been examined for the 1-, 2-, and 9-isomers of anthracenecarboxylic acid. TiO2 samples with either anatase or amorphous crystal structures were used for these experiments. The results from time-resolved transient absorption measurements show that the rates of the forward (dye-to-semiconductor) and reverse (semiconductor-to-dye) electron transfer reactions depend on the chemical structure of the dye and the method used to synthesize the particles. These effects arise from differences in both the energetics and the coupling elements for the reactions. Specifically, the reverse electron transfer reactions for the 1- and 2-isomers are significantly faster than that for the 9-isomer due to differences in the oxidation potentials of the dye molecules. In addition, both the forward and reverse electron-transfer times are faster for the anatase TiO2 particles compared to the amorphous particles. For example, the forward electron transfer time for the anatase particles is ≤200 fs, whereas it is ca. 1.5 ps for the amorphous particles. This is due to a difference in the coupling elements for the forward electron transfer reaction. Finally, all the anthracenecarboxylate dyes examined show red shifts in their UV−vis absorption spectra when they are attached to the semiconductor particles. Experiments with ZrO2 show that these shifts are not due to a charge-transfer band. The spectra are more strongly perturbed when the dye molecules are attached to the anatase particles, which shows that for this series of compounds there is a correlation between the spectral shifts and the time scale for electron transfer.},

abstract = {We report the use of scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) to investigate one-dimensional quantum confinement effects in lead sulfide (PbS) thin films. Specifically, quantum confinement effects on the band gap of PbS quantum wells were explored by controlling the PbS film thickness and potential barrier height. PbS quantum well structures with a thickness range of 1-20 nm were fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Two barrier materials were selected based on barrier height: aluminum oxide as a high barrier material and zinc oxide as a low barrier material. Band gap measurements were carried out by STS, and an effective mass theory was developed to compare the experimental results. Our results show that the band gap of PbS thin films increased as the film thickness decreased, and the barrier height increased from 0.45 to 2.19 eV.},

We have recently suggested that many new dye molecules, intended to improve DSSCs, can accelerate this reaction, negating the expected improvement (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008, 130, 2907). Here we study two dyes with only a two-atom change in the structure, yet which give different V(oc)s. Using a range of measurements we show conclusively that the change in V(oc) is due solely to the increase in the recombination rate. From the structure of the dyes, and literature values for iodine binding of similar compounds, we find that it is very likely that the change in V(oc) is due solely to the difference in iodine binding at the site of the two-atom change. Using the large amount of literature on iodine complexation, we suggest structures for dyes that might show improved V(oc).},

Here we review recent progress in the realization of low-cost, efficient solar cells based on CQDs. We focus in particular on CQD materials and approaches that provide both infrared and visible-wavelength solar power conversion CQD photovoltaics now exceed 5\% solar power conversion efficiency, achieved by the introduction of a new architecture, the depleted-heterojunction CQD solar cell, that jointly maximizes current, voltage, and fill factor. CQD solar cells have also seen major progress in materials processing for stability, recently achieving extended operating lifetimes in an air ambient. We summarize progress both in device operation and also in gaining new insights into materials properties and processing - including new electrical contact materials and deposition techniques, as well as CQD synthesis, surface treatments, film-forming technologies - that underpin these rapid advances.},

abstract = {Hyperspectral femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy is employed to record exciton relaxation and recombination in colloidal lead selenide (PbSe) nanocrystals in unprecedented detail. Results obtained with different pump wavelengths and fluences are scrutinized with regard to three issues: (1) early subpicosecond spectral features due to "hot" excitons are analyzed in terms of suggested underlying mechanisms; (2) global kinetic analysis facilitates separation of the transient difference spectra into single, double, and triple exciton state contributions, from which individual band assignments can be tested; and (3) the transient spectra are screened for signatures of multiexciton generation (MEG) by comparing experiments with excitation pulses both below and well above the theoretical threshold for multiplication. For the latter, a recently devised ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopic approach is employed. Scaling sample concentrations and pump pulse intensities inversely with the extinction coefficient at each excitation wavelength overcomes ambiguities due to direct multiphoton excitation, uncertainties of absolute absorption cross sections, and low signal levels. As observed in a recent application of this method to InAs core/shell/shell nanodots, no sign of MEG was detected in this sample up to photon energy 3.7 times the band gap. Accordingly, numerous reports of efficient MEG in other samples of PbSe suggest that the efficiency of this process varies from sample to sample and depends on factors yet to be determined.},

Our analytical and numerical results show that pure dephasing, defined as the perturbation of system eigenstates through the system-bath interaction, does not disrupt coherent eT because it induces no localization; electron transfer may proceed through superexchange in a system undergoing only pure dephasing. A more physically reasonable description may be obtained via a system-bath interaction that reflects the perturbation of more local electronic structure by local nuclear distortions and dipole interactions. The degree of locality of this interaction is guided by the structure of the system Hamiltonian and by the nature of the measurement performed on the system (i.e., the nature of the environment). We compare our result from this "semilocal" model with an even more local phenomenological dephasing model. We calculate electron transfer rate by obtaining nonequilibrium steady-state solutions for the elements of a reduced density matrix; a semigroup formalism is used to write down the dissipative part of the equation of motion.},

abstract = {Biexcitons feature prominently in various scenarios for utilization of quantum dots (QDs) for enhancing the efficiencies of solar cells, and for the generation of entangled photon pairs in singleQDsources. Two-dimensional double quantum coherence (2D-DQC) nonlinear optical spectra provide novel spectroscopic signatures of such states beyond global intensity and lifetime characteristics which are available by more conventional techniques. We report the simulation of a prototype 2D-DQC optical experiment of a self-assembled InAs/GaAs dot. The simulations consider the QD in different charged states and are based on a state-of-the-art atomistic many-body pseudopotential method for the calculation of the electronic structure and transition dipole matrix elements. Comparison of the spectra of negatively charged, neutral, and positively chargedQDreveals optical signatures of their electronic excitations.This technique directly accesses the biexciton (XX) energies as well as the projections of their wave functions on the single-exciton manifold. These signals also provide a unique tool for probing the charged state of theQDand thus the occupation of the quantum state. Signatures of Pauli blockade of the creation of certain single and two excitons due to charges on the particles are observed. For all quantum states of the QD, the spectra reveal a strong multiconfiguration character of the biexciton wave functions.

abstract = {The astronomical number of accessible discrete chemical structures makes rational molecular design extremely challenging. We formulate the design of molecules with specific tailored properties as performing a continuous optimization in the space of electron-nuclear attraction potentials. The optimization is facilitated by using a linear combination of atomic potentials (LCAP), a general framework that creates a continuous property landscape from an otherwise unlinked set of discrete molecular-property values. A demonstration of this approach is given for the optimization of molecular electronic polarizability and hyperpolarizability. We show that the optimal structures can be determined without enumerating and separately evaluating the characteristics of the combinatorial number of possible structures, a process that would be much slower. The LCAP approach may be used with quantum or classical Hamiltonians, suggesting possible applications to drug design and new materials discovery.},

abstract = {A simple electrostatic method for the calculation of optical transition energies of pigments in protein environments is presented and applied to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex of Prosthecochloris aestuarii and Chlorobium tepidum. The method, for the first time, allows us to reach agreement between experimental optical spectra and calculations based on transition energies of pigments that are calculated in large part independently, rather than fitted to the spectra. In this way it becomes possible to understand the molecular mechanism allowing the protein to trigger excitation energy transfer reactions. The relative shift in excitation energies of the seven bacteriochlorophyll-a pigments of the FMO complex of P. aestuarii and C. tepidum are obtained from calculations of electrochromic shifts due to charged amino acids, assuming a standard protonation pattern of the protein, and by taking into account the three different ligand types of the pigments. The calculations provide an explanation of some of the earlier results for the transition energies obtained from fits of optical spectra. In addition, those earlier fits are verified here by using a more advanced theory of optical spectra, a genetic algorithm, and excitonic couplings obtained from electrostatic calculations that take into account the influence of the dielectric protein environment. The two independent calculations of site energies strongly favor one of the two possible orientations of the FMO trimer relative to the photosynthetic membrane, which were identified by electron microscopic studies and linear dichroism experiments. Efficient transfer of excitation energy to the reaction center requires bacteriochlorophylls 3 and 4 to be the linker pigments. The temporal and spatial transfer of excitation energy through the FMO complex is calculated to proceed along two branches, with transfer times that differ by an order of magnitude.},

abstract = {The observed 6-fs photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from the alizarin chromophore into the TiO2 surface is investigated by ab initio nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics in real time and at the atomistic level of detail. The system derives from the dye-sensitized semiconductor Gr\"{a}tzel cell and addresses the problems of an organic/inorganic interface that are commonly encountered in photovoltaics, photochemistry, and molecular electronics. In contrast to the typical Gr\"{a}tzel cell systems, where molecular donors are in resonance with a high density of semiconductor acceptor states, TiO2 sensitized with alizarin presents a novel case in which the molecular photoexcited state is at the edge of the conduction band (CB). The high level ab initio analysis of the optical absorption spectrum supports this observation. Thermal fluctuations of atomic coordinates are particularly important both in generating a nonuniform distribution of photoexcited states and in driving the ET process. The NA simulation resolves the controversy regarding the origin of the ultrafast ET by showing that although ultrafast transfer is possible with the NA mechanism, it proceeds mostly adiabatically in the alizarin-TiO2 system. The simulation indicates that the electron is injected into a localized surface state within 8 fs and spreads into the bulk on a 100-fs or longer time scale. The molecular architecture seen in the alizarin-TiO2 system permits efficient electron injection into the edge of the CB by an adiabatic mechanism without the energy loss associated with injection high into the CB by a NA process.},

abstract = {The physical basis for observed long-lived electronic coherence in photosynthetic light-harvesting systems is identified using an analytically soluble model. Three physical features are found to be responsible for their long coherence lifetimes, (i) the small energy gap between excitonic states, (ii) the small ratio of the energy gap to the coupling between excitonic states, and (iii) the fact that the molecular characteristics place the system in an effective low-temperature regime, even at ambient conditions. Using this approach, we obtain decoher- ence times for a dimer model with FMO parameters of∼160 fs at 77 K and∼80 fs at 277 K. As such, significant oscillations are found to persist for 600 and 300 fs, respectively, in accord with the experiment and with previous computations. Similar good agreement is found for PC645 at room temperature, with oscillations persisting for 400 fs. The analytic expressions obtained provide direct insight into the parameter dependence of the decoherence time scales.},

The approach accounts for the electronic-ground state of the dye, the first excited state, the ionized state formed after charge injection, and the continuum of the electronic states in the conduction band, all defined vs a single reaction coordinate. To address different control tasks optimal control theory is combined with a full quantum dynamical description of the electron-vibrational motion accompanying the charge injection process. First it is proved in which way the charge injection time can be changed by tailored laser pulses. In a second step a pump-dump scheme from the perylene ground state to the first excited electronic state and back to the ground state is discussed. Because of the strong coupling of the excited perylene state to the band continuum of TiO2 this control task is more suited to an experimental test than the direct control of the charge injection.},

Thermodynamically spontaneous electron transfer occurs from sulfur ions on the surfaces of the QDs (radius = 1.6 nm) to adsorbed TCNQ molecules and creates indefinitely stable ion pairs that are characterized by steady-state visible and mid-infrared absorption spectroscopy of reduced TCNQ and by NMR spectroscopy of the protons of oleate ligands that coat the QDs. The combination of these techniques shows that (i) each QD reduces an average of 4.5 TCNQ molecules, (ii) every electron transfer event between the QD and TCNQ occurs at the QD surface, (iii) sulfur ions on the surfaces of the QDs (and not delocalized states within the QDs) are the electron donors, and (iv) some TCNQ molecules adsorb directly to the surface of the QDs while others adsorb upon displacement of oleate ligands.},

abstract = {The most commonly used theoretical models for describing chemical kinetics are accurate in two limits. When relaxation is fast with respect to reaction time scales, thermal transition state theory (TST) is the theoretical tool of choice. In the limit of slow relaxation, an energy resolved description like RRKM theory is more appropriate. For intermediate relaxation regimes, where much of the chemistry in nature occurs, theoretical approaches are somewhat less well established. However, in recent years master equation approaches have been successfully used to analyze and predict nonequilibrium chemical kinetics across a range of intermediate relaxation regimes spanning atmospheric, combustion, and (very recently) solution phase organic chemistry. In this article, we describe a Master Equation Solver for Multi-Energy Well Reactions (MESMER), a user-friendly, object-oriented, open-source code designed to facilitate kinetic simulations over multi-well molecular energy topologies where energy transfer with an external bath impacts phenomenological kinetics. MESMER offers users a range of user options specified via keywords and also includes some unique statistical mechanics approaches like contracted basis set methods and nonadiabatic RRKM theory for modeling spin-hopping. It is our hope that the design principles implemented in MESMER will facilitate its development and usage by workers across a range of fields concerned with chemical kinetics. As accurate thermodynamics data become more widely available, electronic structure theory is increasingly reliable, and as our fundamental understanding of energy transfer improves, we envision that tools like MESMER will eventually enable routine and reliable prediction of nonequilibrium kinetics in arbitrary systems.},

abstract = {Ultrafast transient absorption measurements reveal that the rate of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from colloidal CdSe quantum dots (QDs) to oxo-centered triruthenium clusters (Ru3O) depends on the structure of the chemical headgroup by which the Ru3O clusters adsorb to the QDs. Complexes comprising QDs and Ru3O clusters adsorbed through a pyridine-4-carboxylic acid ligand (nic-Ru3O) have an intrinsic PET rate constant of (4.9 ± 0.9) × 109 s−1 whereas complexes comprising QDs and Ru3O clusters adsorbed through a 4-mercaptopyridine ligand (thiol-Ru3O) have an intrinsic PET rate constant of (36 ± 7) × 109 s−1. Cyclic voltammetry measurements of nic-Ru3O and thiol-Ru3O yield reduction potentials vs. Ag/AgCl of −0.93 V for both clusters, and density functional theory calculations of the nic-Ru3O and thiol-Ru3O clusters yield internal reorganization energies for the cluster radical anion of −0.17 eV and −0.19 eV, respectively. The small differences in driving force and reorganization energy between the two complexes rule out these parameters as possible explanations for the factor-of-seven difference in the rate constants for PET. The difference in the observed rates of PET for the two complexes is therefore attributable to a difference in donor–acceptor electronic coupling, which, according to electronic structure calculations, is modulated by the torsional angle between the Ru3O core of the cluster and the functionalized pyridine ligand that bridges the cluster to the QD surface.},

As an example, optically induced vibrational wave packets in the so‐called curve–crossing system are considered. Such a system goes beyond the standard treatment of optical phenomena since the vibrational wave packet moves in a double well potential and is subject to environmental influences like wave function dephasing and relaxation. The complete theoretical description has been carried out in a representation of the vibrational wave functions of the diabatic states which refer to the two coupled vibrational surfaces. Solving the corresponding density matrix equations by numerical methods allows us to incorporate the static coupling between the crossed surfaces in a nonperturbative manner. Standard projection operator technique is used to treat environmental contributions up to the second order. For the case of a bilinear coupling between the molecular system and the environment we determine the time development of an initially prepared Gaussian wave packet. Corresponding time‐resolved spectra of a pump–probe configuration are also derived. The developed formalism is finally applied to the system of the coupled electronic states c′ 1$\Sigma$+u and b′ 1$\Sigma$+u of the N2 molecule.},

abstract = {SUNDIALS is a suite of advanced computational codes for solving large-scale problems that can be modeled as a system of nonlinear algebraic equations, or as initial-value problems in ordi- nary differential or differential-algebraic equations. The basic versions of these codes are called KINSOL, CVODE, and IDA, respectively. The codes are written in ANSI standard C and are suit- able for either serial or parallelmachine environments.Commonand notable features of these codes include inexact Newton-Krylov methods for solving large-scale nonlinear systems; linear multistep methods for time-dependent problems; a highly modular structure to allow incorporation of differ- ent preconditioning and/or linear solver methods; and clear interfaces allowing for users to provide their own data structures underneath the solvers.We describe the current capabilities of the codes, along with some of the algorithms and heuristics used to achieve efficiency and robustness.We also describe how the codes stem from previous and widely used Fortran 77 solvers, and how the codes have been augmented with forward and adjoint methods for carrying out first-order sensitivity analysis with respect to model parameters or initial conditions.},

abstract = {A simple approach which can describe both coherent tunneling and sequential tunneling is applied to resonant tunneling through a double-barrier structure. This approach models phase-randomizing events by connecting to the conductor a side branch leading away from the conductor to a reservoir. The reservoir does not draw or supply a net current, but permits inelastic events and phase randomization. A conductance formula is obtained which contains contributions due to both coherent and sequential tunneling. We discuss the limiting regimes of completely coherent tunneling and completely incoherent transmission, and discuss the continuous transition between the two. Over a wide range of inelastic scattering times tunneling is sequential. The effect of inelastic events on the peak-to-valley ratio and the density of states in the resonant well is investigated. We also present an analytic discussion of the masimum peak conductance e/h of an isolated resonance in a many-channel conductor.},

We briefly describe a pulse-shaping-based implementation of two-dimensional spectroscopy that is making the method widely accessible to problems spanning frequency regimes from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared. We illustrate the utility of 2DES in the context of our recent studies of the primary energy-transfer and charge separation events in the photosystem II reaction center, discussing remaining challenges and speculating about exciting future directions for the field of multidimensional spectroscopy.},

The effects of carboxylic and phosphonic acid anchor groups, as well as a phenylene spacer group, on the optical properties of the dyes and the electronic interactions in the dye-sensitized TiO2 nanoparticles have been investigated. Inclusion of explicit counterions in the modeling shows that the description of the environment is important in order to obtain a realistic interfacial energy level alignment. A comparison of calculated electronic coupling strengths suggests that both the nature of the anchor group and the inclusion of the phenylene spacer group are capable of significantly influencing electron-transfer rates across the dye-metal oxide interface.},

In order to understand the dynamical process of polaron formation in lithium peroxide, we examine the initial embryonic stage of this process through first-principles calculations of the electron-phonon interaction between the lithium peroxide lattice and an extra electron injected into the crystal. It is shown that the electron-phonon interaction is perceivably strong with such phonons whose vibration patterns map directly onto the lattice distortions that occur when a polaron is actually formed. These patterns indicate the elongation of the bond length of the O2−2 ions and contraction of the surrounding Li+ ions.},

@article{Liu2009,
abstract = {Bioconjugated CdSe quantum dots are promising reagents for bioimaging applications. Experimentally, the binding of a short peptide has been found to redshift the optical absorption of nanoclusters [J. Tsay et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 109, 1669 (2005)]. This study examines this issue by performing density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent-DFT calculations to study the ground state and low-lying excited states of (CdSe)(6)[SCH(3)](-), a transition metal complex built by binding methanethiolate to a CdSe molecular cluster. Natural bond orbital results show that the redshift is caused by ligand-inorganic cluster orbital interaction. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of (CdSe)(6) is dominated by selenium 4p orbitals; in contrast, the HOMO of (CdSe)(6)[SCH(3)](-) is dominated by sulfur 3p orbitals. This difference shows that [SCH(3)](-) binding effectively introduces filled sulfur orbitals above the selenium 4p orbitals of (CdSe)(6). The resulting smaller HOMO-LUMO gap of (CdSe)(6)[SCH(3)](-) indeed leads to redshifts in its excitation energies compared to (CdSe)(6). In contrast, binding of multiple NH(3) destabilizes cadmium 5p orbitals, which contribute significantly to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of (CdSe)(6), while leaving the selenium 4p orbitals near the HOMO relatively unaffected. This has the effect of widening the HOMO-LUMO gap of (CdSe)(6)6NH(3) compared to (CdSe)(6). As expected, the excitation energies of the passivated (CdSe)(6)6NH(3) are also blueshifted compared to (CdSe)(6). As far as NH(3) is a faithful representation of a surfactant, the results clearly illustrate the differences between the electronic effects of an alkylthiolate versus those of surfactant molecules. Surface passivation of (CdSe)(6)[SCH(3)](-) is then simulated by coating it with multiple NH(3) molecules. The results suggest that the [SCH(3)](-) adsorption induces a redshift in the excitation energies in a surfactant environment.},

abstract = {Recent theoretical studies on linear absorption spectra of dye-semiconductor systems [perylene attached to nanostructured TiO2, L. Wang et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 109, 9589 (2005)] are extended here in different respects. Since the systems show ultrafast photoinduced heterogeneous electron transfer the time-dependent formulation used to compute the absorbance is also applied to calculate the temporal evolution of the sub-100 fs charge injection dynamics after a 10 fs laser-pulse excitation. These studies complement our recent absorption spectra fit for two perylene bridge-anchor group TiO2 systems. Moreover, the time-dependent formulation of the absorbance is confronted with a frequency-domain description. The latter underlines the central importance of the self-energy caused by the coupling of the dye levels to the semiconductor band continuum. The used model is further applied to study the effect of different parameters such as (1) the dependence on the reorganization energies of the involved intramolecular transitions, (2) the effect of changing the transfer integral which couples the excited dye state with the band continuum, and (3) the effect of the concrete form of the semiconductor band density of states. Emphasis is also put on the case where the charge injection level of the dye is near or somewhat below the band edge. This nicely demonstrates the change from a structureless absorption to a well-resolved vibrational progression including characteristic shifts of the absorption lines which are a direct measure for the dye-semiconductor coupling.},

abstract = {Thin shell CdSe/CdS colloidal quantum dots with a small 3 nm core diameter exhibit typical blinking and a binary PL intensity distribution. Electrochemical charging with one electron suppresses the blinking. With a larger core of 5 nm, the blinking statistics of on and off states is identical to that of a smaller core but the dots also display a grey state with a finite duration time (∼6 ms) on glass. However, the grey state disappears on the electron-accepting ZnO nanocrystals film. In addition, the grey state PL lifetime on glass is similar to the trion lifetime measured from electrochemically charged dots. Therefore, the grey state is assigned to the photocharged negative dots. It is concluded that a grey state is always present as the dots get negatively photocharged even though it might not be observed due to the brightness of the trion and/or the duration time of the negative charge. With thick shell CdSe/CdS dots under electrochemical control, multiple charging, up to four electrons per dot, is observed as sequential changes in the photoluminescence lifetime which can be described by the Nernst equation. The small potential increment confirms the weak electron confinement with the thick CdS shell. Finally, the mechanism of hole-trapping and surface oxidation by the hole is proposed to account for the grey state and off state in the blinking.},

abstract = {This review describes recent research into the properties of the chromophore-TiO2 interface that forms the basis for photoinduced charge separation in dye-sensitized semiconductor solar cells. It focuses particularly on an atomistic picture of the electron-injection dynamics. The interface offers an excellent case study, pertinent as well to a variety of other photovoltaic systems, photo- and electrochemistry, molecular electronics, analytical detection, photography, and quantum confinement devices. The differences between chemists' and physicists' models for describing molecules and bulk materials, respectively, create challenges for the characterization of interfaces that include both of these components. We give an overall picture of the interface by starting with a description of the properties of the chromophores and semiconductor separately, and then by discussing the coupled system, including the chromophore-semiconductor binding, electronic structure, and electron-injection dynamics. Explicit time-dependent modeling is particularly valuable for an understanding of the ultrafast electron injection because it shows a variety of individual injection events with well-defined dynamical features that cannot be made apparent by an average reaction-rate description.},

abstract = {This paper describes a study of the generation and flow of photocurrent through junctions containing three-dimensional arrays of colloidal CdSe quantum dots (QDs) of either a single size or multiple sizes. The electrodes were indium tin oxide (ITO) covered with a thin layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy- thiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and a eutectic alloy of Ga and In (EGaIn). We measured the current-voltage characteristics of the junctions in the dark and under illumination, with various sources and wavelengths of excitation, and their photocurrent action spectra. Size-selective photoexcitation of the arrays of multiple sizes of QDs helped to determine (i) the location of the interface at which photoinduced separation of charge occurred, (ii) whether the energy absorbed by the QDs was redistributed before separation of charge, and (iii) the dependence of the photovoltage on the locations of various sizes of QDs within the junction. This research is a step toward the use of QDs for harvesting light and for transporting energy and charge in devicessfor example, solar cells and photodetectorssthat operate at zero bias.},

abstract = {We report ultra-efficient multiple exciton generation (MEG) for single photon absorption in colloidal PbSe and PbS quantum dots (QDs). We employ transient absorption spectroscopy and present measurement data acquired for both intraband as well as interband probe energies. Quantum yields of 300\% indicate the creation, on average, of three excitons per absorbed photon for PbSe QDs at photon energies that are four times the QD energy gap. Results indicate that the threshold photon energy for MEG in QDs is twice the lowest exciton absorption energy. We find that the biexciton effect, which shifts the transition energy for absorption of a second photon, influences the early time transient absorption data and may contribute to a modulation observed when probing near the lowest interband transition. We present experimental and theoretical values of the size-dependent interband transition energies for PbSe QDs. We present experimental and theoretical values of the size-dependent interband transition energies for PbSe QDs, and we also introduce a new model for MEG based on the coherent superposition of multiple excitonic states.},

abstract = {First-principles computer simulations can contribute to a deeper understanding of the dye/semiconductor interface lying at the heart of DSCs. Here, we present the results of simulation of dye adsorption onto TiO2 surfaces, and of their implications for the functioning of dye-sensitized solar cells. We propose an integrated strategy which combines FT-IR measurements with DFT first principles simulations to individuate the energetically favorable adsorption mode acetic acid, as a meaningful model for realistic organic dyes. Although we found a sizable variability in the relative stability of the considered adsorption modes with the model system and method, a bridged bidentate structure was found to closely match the FT-IR frequency pattern, also being calculated as the most stable adsorption mode by calculations in solution. The bridged bidentate adsorption mode was found to be the most stable binding for realistic organic dyes bearing cyanoacrylic anchoring groups, while for a rhodanine-3-acetic acid anchoring group, an undissociated monodentate adsorption mode was found to be of comparable stability. The structural differences induced by the different anchoring groups were related to the different electron injection / recombination with oxidized dye properties which were experimentally assessed for the two classes of dyes. A stronger coupling and a possibly faster electron injection was also calculated for the bridged bidentate mode. We then investigated the adsorption mode and I2 binding of prototype organic dyes. Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics and geometry optimizations were performed for two coumarin dyes differing by the length of the pi-bridge separating the donor and acceptor moieties. We related the decreasing distance of the carbonylic oxygen from the titania to an increased I2 concentration in proximity of the oxide surface, which might account for the different observed photovoltaic performances. The interplay between theory/simulation and experiments appears the key to further DSCs progress, both concerning the design of new dye sensitizers and their interaction with the semiconductor and with the solution environment and/or electrolyte upon adsorption onto the semiconductor.},

In this work, we present a significant step forward towards this goal for those charge transfer excitations that take place between non-covalently bound molecules. In particular, we present a method that scales linearly with the number of non-covalently bound molecules in the system and is based on a two-pronged approach: The molecular electronic structure of broken-symmetry charge-localized states is obtained with the frozen density embedding formulation of subsystem density-functional theory; subsequently, in a post-SCF calculation, the full-electron Hamiltonian and overlap matrix elements among the charge-localized states are evaluated with an algorithm which takes full advantage of the subsystem DFT density partitioning technique. The method is benchmarked against coupled-cluster calculations and achieves chemical accuracy for the systems considered for intermolecular separations ranging from hydrogen-bond distances to tens of Ångstroms. Numerical examples are provided for molecular clusters comprised of up to 56 non-covalently bound molecules.},

abstract = {We developed a model for hole migration along relatively short DNA hairpins with fewer that seven adenine (A):thymine (T) base pairs. The model was used to simulate hole migration along poly(A)-poly(T) sequences with a particular emphasis on the impact of partial hole localization on the different rate processes. The simulations, performed within the framework of the stochastic surrogate Hamiltonian approach, give values for the arrival rate in good agreement with experimental data. Theoretical results obtained for hairpins with fewer than three A:T base pairs suggest that hole transfer along short hairpins occurs via superexchange. This mechanism is characterized by the exponential distance dependence of the arrival rate on the donor/acceptor distance, ka ≃ e-$\beta$R, with $\beta$ = 0.9 \AA-1. For longer systems, up to six A:T pairs, the distance dependence follows a power law ka ≃ R-$\eta$ with $\eta$ = 2. Despite this seemingly clear signature of unbiased hopping, our simulations show the complete delocalization of the hole density along the entire hairpin. According to our analysis, the hole transfer along relatively long sequences may proceed through a mechanism which is distinct from both coherent single-step superexchange and incoherent multistep hopping. The criterion for the validity of this mechanism intermediate between superexchange and hopping is proposed. The impact of partial localization on the rate of hole transfer between neighboring A bases was also investigated.},

Structures of all bacteriochlorophyll pigments have been optimized in their binding pockets, comprising more than 1000 atoms in some cases. We find that the site energies are quite sensitive to structural and environmental changes in the model setup, while excitonic couplings are more robust.

Room temperature spin-polarized transient EPR measurements show that in the PsaA-L722T mutant, the rate of PhQA is possible for the OH group of the Thr side chain to form an H-bond to the carbonyl oxygen atom, O4 of the phylloquinone, and that this results in an increase in the 2- methyl hyperfine couplings as observed in the transient EPR data. The Arrhenius plot of the PhQA − to FX ET increases and the hyperfine behavior observed at ∼200 K can be reproduced using a semiclassical model, which takes the zero-point energy of the mode coupled to the ET into account. However, since the change in slope of the Arrhenius plot occurs at the protein glass transition temperature, it is argued that it could be the result of a change in the protein relaxation dynamics at this temperature rather than quantum mechanical effects. − to FX ET in the PsaA-L722T mutant suggests that the increased rate is probably the result of a slight change in the electronic coupling between PhQA − and FX.

Optimal control enables efficient optimization of NMR experiments in terms of amplitudes, phases, offsets etc. for hundreds-to-thousands of pulses to fully exploit the experimentally available high degree of freedom in pulse sequences to combat variations/limitations in experimental or spin system parameters or design experiments with specific properties typically not covered as easily by standard design procedures. This facilitates straightforward optimization of experiments under consideration of rf and static field inhomogeneities, limitations in available or desired rf field strengths (e.g., for reduction of sample heating), spread in resonance offsets or coupling parameters, variations in spin systems etc. to meet the actual experimental conditions as close as possible. The paper provides a brief account on the relevant theory and in particular the computational interface relevant for optimization of state-to-state transfer (on the density operator level) and the effective Hamiltonian on the level of propagators along with several representative examples within liquid- and solid-state NMR spectroscopy.},

abstract = {We report simulations of the two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy of the Q(y) band of the D1-D2-Cyt b559 photosystem II reaction center at 77 K. We base the simulations on an existing Hamiltonian that was derived by simultaneous fitting to a wide range of linear spectroscopic measurements and described within modified Redfield theory. The model obtains reasonable agreement with most aspects of the two-dimensional spectra, including the overall peak shapes and excited state absorption features. It does not reproduce the rapid equilibration from high energy to low energy excitonic states evident by a strong cross-peak below the diagonal. We explore modifications to the model to incorporate new structural data and improve agreement with the two-dimensional spectra. We find that strengthening the system-bath coupling and lowering the degree of disorder significantly improves agreement with the cross-peak feature, while lessening agreement with the relative diagonal/antidiagonal width of the 2D spectra. We conclude that two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy provides a sensitive test of excitonic models of the photosystem II reaction center and discuss avenues for further refinement of such models.},

abstract = {In order to achieve practical implementations of emerging quantum technologies, it is important to have a firm understanding of the dynamics of realistic quantum open systems. Master equations provide a widely used tool in this regard. In this work we first construct a master equation, valid for weak system-environment coupling, which explicitly takes into account the impact of preparing an initial system state from an equilibrium system-environment state that has system-environment correlations.We then investigate the role of initial system- environment correlations using this master equation for a system consisting of many two-level atoms interacting with a common environment. We show that, in general, due to the initial system-environment correlations before a state preparation, the quantum state of the system can evolve at a faster time scale. Moreover, we also consider different initial state preparations, and demonstrate that the influence of state preparations depends on the initial states prepared. Our results can be of interest to many topics based on quantum open systems where system-environment correlation effects have been neglected before.},

The previously reported crystal structures for these two proteins did not disclose any rationale that would explain their spectral differences. We have collected a 1.3 A X-ray diffraction dataset of the FMO from Prosthecochloris aestuarii 2K, which has allowed us to identify an additional Bacteriochlorophyll-a molecule with chemical attachments to both sides of the central magnesium atom. A new analysis of the previously published X-ray data for the Chlorobaculum tepidum FMO shows the presence of a Bacteriochlorophyll-a molecule in an equivalent location but with a chemical attachment from only one side. This difference in binding is shown to be predictive of the spectral type of the FMO.},

abstract = {In this paper, we perform many-electron dynamics using the time-dependent configuration-interaction method in its reduced density matrix formulation ($\rho$-TDCI). Dissipation is treated implicitly using the Lindblad formalism. To include the effect of ionization on the state-resolved dynamics, we extend a recently introduced heuristic model for ionizing states to the $\rho$-TDCI method, which leads to a reduced density matrix evolution that is not norm-preserving. We apply the new method to the laser-driven excitation of H(2) in a strongly dissipative environment, for which the state-resolve lifetimes are tuned to a few femtoseconds, typical for dynamics of adsorbate at metallic surfaces. Further testing is made on the laser-induced intramolecular charge transfer in a quinone derivative as a model for a molecular switch. A modified scheme to treat ionizing states is proposed to reduce the computational burden associated with the density matrix propagation, and it is thoroughly tested and compared to the results obtained with the former model. The new approach scales favorably (∼N(2)) with the number of configurations N used to represent the reduced density matrix in the $\rho$-TDCI method, as compared to a N(3) scaling for the model in its original form.},

This redistribution significantly affects the QD and QW PL intensities depending both on the dot-well barrier thickness and height. For comparatively thin barriers, the interplay between tunnel and thermal carrier fluxes becomes crucial, governing the exciton dynamics in a tunnel injection dot-well structure at elevated temperatures. For a sufficiently thick spacer, it is shown that exciton localization within the QW, apparently induced by QD strain fields, has a profound influence on the transfer dynamics at low temperatures.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) vibrational spectroscopy is an experimental tool for investigating molecular dynamics in solution on a picosecond time scale. We present experimental and theoretical methods for obtaining a 2D IR correlation spectrum and modeling the underlying microscopic information. Fourier transform 2D spectra are obtained from heterodyne-detected third-order nonlinear signals using a sequence of broad bandwidth femtosecond IR pulses. A 2D IR correlation spectrum with absorptive line shapes results from the addition of 2D rephasing and nonrephasing spectra, which sample conjugate frequencies during the initial evolution time period. The 2D IR spectrum contains peaks with different positions, signs, amplitudes, and line shapes characterizing the vibrational eigenstates of the system and their interactions with the surrounding bath. The positions of the peaks map the transition frequencies between the ground, singly, and doubly excited states of the system and thus describe the anharmonic vibrational potential. Peak amplitudes reflect the relative magnitudes and orientations of the transition dipole moments in the molecular frame, the electrical anharmonicity of the system, and the vibrational relaxation dynamics. The 2D line shapes are sensitive to the system-bath interactions in solution. We illustrate how 2D IR spectra taken with varying polarization conditions and as a function of a variable waiting time can be used to isolate and quantify these spectroscopic observables. As a model vibrational system, we use the strongly coupled asymmetric and symmetric carbonyl stretches of Rh(CO)2C5H7O2 (RDC) dissolved in hexane and chloroform. The polarization-selective 2D IR spectra of RDC in hexane are analyzed in terms of two coupled local coordinates to obtain their mutual orientation and the magnitude of the coupling between them. The 2D line-shape study of RDC in chloroform performed as a function of the waiting period characterizes the system-bath interactions, revealing that the system transition energies fluctuate in a correlated manner.},

To contribute to this debate we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the coupling between the protein environment and the vertical excitation energies of individual bacteriochlorophyll molecules in the FMO complex of the green sulphur bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum. The so-called spectral densities, which account for the environmental influence on the excited state dynamics, are determined from temporal autocorrelation functions of the energy gaps between ground and first excited states of the individual pigments. Although the overall shape of the spectral density is found to be rather similar for all pigments, variations in their magnitude can be seen. Differences between the spectral densities for the pigments of the FMO monomer and FMO trimer are also presented.},

To realize this unusual degree of stability at the single-dot level, novel InP/CdS core/shell NQDs were synthesized for a range of shell thicknesses (∼1-11 monolayers of CdS). Ensemble spectroscopy measurements (photoluminescence peak position and radiative lifetimes) and electronic structure calculations established the transition from type-I to type-II band alignment in these heterostructured NQDs. More significantly, single-NQD studies revealed clear evidence for blinking suppression that was not strongly shell-thickness dependent, while photobleaching and biexciton lifetimes trended explicitly with extent of shelling. Specifically, very long biexciton lifetimes-up to >7 ns-were obtained for the thickest-shell structures, indicating dramatic suppression of nonradiative Auger recombination. This new system demonstrates that electronic structure and shell thickness can be employed together to effect control over key single-dot and ensemble NQD photophysical properties.},

abstract = {We explore how in response calculations for excitation energies with wavefunction based (e.g., coupled cluster) methods the number of double excitation amplitudes can be reduced by means of truncated pair natural orbital (PNO) expansions and localized occupied orbitals. Using the CIS(D) approximation as a test model, we find that the number of double excitation amplitudes can be reduced dramatically with minor impact on the accuracy if the excited state wavefunction is expanded in state-specific PNOs generated from an approximate first-order guess wavefunction. As for ground states, the PNO truncation error can also for excitation energies be controlled by a single threshold related to generalized natural occupation numbers. The best performance is found with occupied orbitals which are localized by the Pipek-Mezey localization. For a large test set of excited states we find with this localization that already a PNO threshold of 10(-8)-10(-7), corresponding to an average of only 40-80 PNOs per pair, is sufficient to keep the PNO truncation error for vertical excitation energies below 0.01 eV. This is a significantly more rapid convergence with the number doubles amplitudes than in domain-based local response approaches. We demonstrate that the number of significant excited state PNOs scales asymptotically linearly with the system size in the worst case of completely delocalized excitations and sub-linearly whenever the chromophore does not increase with the system size. Moreover, we observe that the flexibility of state-specific PNOs to adapt to the character of an excitation allows for an almost unbiased treatment of local, delocalized and charge transfer excited states.},

Infrared light can be harvested by use of lead-chalcogenide quantum dot sensitizers. However, bulk-heterojunction solar cells with quantum-dot sensitizers are inefficient. Here we use ultrafast transient absorption and time-domain terahertz spectroscopy to show that charge localization on the quantum dot leads to enhanced coulomb attraction of its counter charge in the organic semiconductor. This localization-enhanced coulomb attraction is the fundamental cause of the poor efficiency of these photovoltaic architectures. It is of prime importance for improving solar cell efficiency to directly photogenerate spatially separated charges. This can be achieved when both charges are delocalized. Our findings provide a rationalization in the development of photovoltaic architectures that exploit quantum dots to harvest the near-infrared part of the solar spectrum more efficiently.},

abstract = {To gain a better understanding of the influence of ligand-surface interactions on nanocrystalline growth, periodic density functional theory calculations were employed in the study of the binding of organic ligands on the relaxed nonpolar (1120) and polar Se terminated (0001) surfaces and the relaxed and vacancy and adatom reconstructed Cd terminated (0001) surface. We examined chemisorption properties of phosphine, amine, phosphine oxide, carboxylic acid, and phosphinic acid model ligands, including preferred binding sites and geometries, vibrational frequencies, and binding energetics, and compared findings to intrinsic growth via addition of CdSe molecules or Cd and Se atoms. Our results indicate that binding of the ligands is preferred in the electron-poor 1-fold sites on all surfaces, with secondary coordination of the acidic ligands through the hydroxyl hydrogen to the electron-rich surface sites. In general ligand adsorption directly obstructs binding sites for growth species on the (1120) surface and only indirectly on the two polar surfaces. The order of binding affinities on the (1120) and (0001) surfaces is PH(3) < OPH(3) approximately HCOOH < NH(3) < OPH(2)OH and that on the (0001) surface is OPH(3) approximately HCOOH < OPH(2)OH < NH(3) < PH(3). Our findings corroborate the experimental observation that incorporation of the nonbulky phosphinic acid-type ligands with high affinity and high selectivity for both the (1120) and (0001) surfaces strongly enhances unidirectional growth on the (0001) surface, while incorporation of either bulky ligands or ligands with moderate affinity does not. Higher affinity of all traditionally used ligands for the (1120) surface compared to the (0001) surface also suggests that new ligands should be engineered to achieve the synthesis of novel shapes that require preferential growth on the (1120) surface.},

abstract = {The capture and transduction of energy in biological systems is clearly necessary for life, and nature has evolved remarkable macromolecular entities to serve these purposes. The Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex serves as an intermediate to transfer the energy from the chlorosome to the special pairs of different photo systems. Recent observations have both suggested the importance of coherent exciton transport within the FMO and motivated an elegant and appropriate theoretical construct for interpreting these observations. Here we employ a different approach to exciton transport in a relaxing environment, one based on the stochastic surrogate Hamiltonian method. With it, we calculate the quantum trajectories through the FMO complex both for the model involving seven bacteriochlorophylls that has been used before, and for one involving an eighth bacteriochlorophyll, which has been observed in some new and very important structural work. We find that in both systems, efficient energy transfer to the ultimate receptor occurs, but that because of the placement of, and energy relaxation among, the different bacteriochlorophyll subunits in the FMO complex, the importance of coherent oscillation that was discussed extensively for the seven site system is far less striking for the eight site system, effectively because of the weak mixing between the initial site and the remainder of the system. We suggest that the relevant spectral densities can be determinative for the energy transport route and may provide a new way to enhance energy transfer in artificial devices.},

These observations have ignited multidisciplinary interest in the role of quantum effects in biological systems, including the fundamental question of how electronic coherence can survive in biological surroundings. Here we show that the non-trivial spectral structures of protein fluctuations can generate non-equilibrium processes that lead to the spontaneous creation and sustenance of electronic coherence, even at physiological temperatures. Developing new advanced simulation tools to treat these effects, we provide a firm microscopic basis to successfully reproduce the experimentally observed coherence times in the Fenna–Matthews–Olson complex, and illustrate how detailed quantum modelling and simulation can shed further light on a wide range of other non-equilibrium processes which may be important in different photosynthetic systems.},

abstract = {Hot electronic dynamics in lead sulfide nanocrystals is interrogated by degenerate pump-probe spectroscopy with 20-25 fs pulses over a broad frequency range around three times the nanocrystal band gap. For each nanocrystal diameter, an initial reduction in absorption is seen only at the peak of the quantum confined E1 transition, while increased absorption is seen at all other wavelengths. The signals from the nanocrystals are approximately 300 times weaker than expected for a two-level system with the same absorbance and molar extinction coefficient and are weaker near time zero. These results appear to be inconsistent with quantum confinement of the initially excited high energy states. Arguments based on carrier scattering length, the wave packet size supported by the band structure, and effective mass are advanced to support the hypothesis that, for many direct-gap semiconductor quantum dots, the carrier dynamics at three times the band gap is localized on the 1-2 nm length scale and essentially bulklike except for frequent collisions with the surface.},

abstract = {We have studied the electron transfer occurring in the photosystem I (PSI) reaction center from the special pair to the first iron-sulfur cluster. Electronic structure calculations performed at the DFT level were employed to determine the on-site energies of the fragments comprising PSI, as well as the charge transfer integrals between neighboring pairs. This electronic Hamiltonian was then used to compute the charge transfer dynamics, using the stochastic surrogate Hamiltonian approach to account for the coherent propagation of the electronic density but also for its energy relaxation and decoherence. These simulations give reasonable transfer time ranging from subpicoseconds to nanoseconds and predict coherent oscillations for several picoseconds. Due to these long-lasting coherences, the propagation of the electronic density can be enhanced or inhibited by quantum interferences. The impact of random fluctuations and asymmetries on these interferences is then discussed. Random fluctuations lead to a classical transport where both constructive and destructive quantum interferences are suppressed. Finally it is shown that an energy difference of 0.15 eV between the on-site energies of the phylloquinones leads to a highly efficient electron transfer even in presence of strong random fluctuations.},

Necessary many-electron integrals over Gaussian-type functions involving Slater-type geminals are evaluated by means of the resolution-of-the-identity approximation with a complementary auxiliary basis set. These integrals and thus the final correlation energy are shown to have the correct size dependence. The valence MP2 correlation energy of polyethylene near the complete basis-set limit is obtained and shown to be considerably greater in magnitude than the value obtained without the R12 treatment.},

Specifically, the effect of electron-vibrational interactions on the electronic transport induced by femtosecond omega+2omega laser fields along unbiased molecular nanojunctions is investigated. For this, the photoinduced vibronic dynamics of trans-polyacetylene oligomers coupled to macroscopic metallic leads is followed in a mean-field mixed quantum-classical approximation. A reduced description of the dynamics is obtained by introducing projective lead-molecule couplings and deriving an effective Schrodinger equation satisfied by the orbitals in the molecular region. Two possible rectification mechanisms are identified and investigated. The first one relies on near-resonance photon-absorption and is shown to be fragile to the ultrafast electronic decoherence processes introduced by the wire's vibrations. The second one employs the dynamic Stark effect and is demonstrated to be highly efficient and robust to electron-vibrational interactions.},

Without further approximations, the DFT-in-DFT embedding approach results in a pair of coupled Euler-Lagrange equations. In contrast to DFT-in-DFT, the WFT-in-DFT approach is shown to ensure a systematic description of excited states if such states are mainly related to excitations within the embedded subsystem.

The junctions were diodes, and their turn-on voltage depended on the size of the QDs next to the PEDOT:PSS.

abstract = {The ability to confine electrons and holes in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) in the form of excitons creates an electronic structure whichisbothnovel andpotentially useful fora variety of applications.Upon optical excitation of the dot, the initial excitonic statemay be electronically hot. The relaxation dynamics of this hot exciton is the primary event which controls key processes such as optical gain, hot carrier extraction, and multiple exciton generation. Here, we describe femtosecond state-resolved pump/probe experiments on colloidal CdSequantum dots that provide the first quantitativemeasure of excitonic state-to-state transition rates.The measurements andmodeling here reveal that there are multiple paths by which hot electrons and hot holes relax. The immediate result is that there is no phonon bottleneck for electrons or holes for excitons in quantum dots. This absence of phonon-based relaxation is confirmed by independent measurements of weak excitonphonon coupling between the various excitonic states of the dot and the optical and acoustic phonons. We show that the divergence of prior results can be reconciled by adopting this multichannel picture of hot exciton relaxation dynamics. This picture establishes a framework for designing materialswith relaxation properties targeted for specific applications.We concludewith connection to hot exciton surface trapping. The process of surface trapping is the key step in creation of the photoproduct which can obscuremeasurements of optical gain,multiexciton recombination,multiple exciton generation, and single dot blinking.We showthat hot exciton surface trapping can effectively compete with hot exciton relaxation, thereby obfuscating these processes. 1. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION 1.1. Motivation. The semiconductor quantum dot has been under intense investigation for an understanding of the influence of quantum confinement effects upon the system’s response, as well as for devices which aim to exploit these effects.115 The chemically synthesized colloidal form of the quantum dot (QD) is also referred to as a semiconductor nanocrystal (NC). Regard- less of terminology, the simplest picture of the QD is that of a particle in a sphere.16,17 This simple picture immediately ratio- nalizes the well-known size-dependent absorption and emission spectral energies.18 This picture also suggests that the energy level spacing in these QDs might be unique, size dependent, and ultimately controllable. This situation of a controllable energy spectrum suggests that the time scales and pathways by which excited carriers relax might also be unique in these quantumdots. Hence, the question of hot carrier cooling has been extensively investigated since the earliest work in quantum dots. The motivation for investigating hot carrier relaxation (i.e., cooling) can be connected to several situations of contemporary rXXXX American Chemical Society A interest (Figure 1). One of the earliest motivatio},

abstract = {A production level implementation of the closed-shell local quadratic configuration interaction and coupled cluster methods with single and double excitations (QCISD and CCSD) based on the concept of pair natural orbitals [local pair natural orbital LPNO-QCISD and LPNO-CCSD) is reported, evaluated, and discussed. This work is an extension of the earlier developed LPNO coupled-electron pair approximation (LNPO-CEPA) method [F. Neese et al., Chem. Phys. 130, 114108 (2009)] and makes extended use of the resolution of the identity (RI) or density fitting (DF) approximation. Two variants of each method are compared. The less accurate approximations (LPNO2-QCISD/LPNO2-CCSD) still recover 98.7\%-99.3\% of the correlation energy in the given basis and have modest disk space requirements. The more accurate variants (LPNO1-QCISD/LPNO1-CCSD) typically recover 99.75\%-99.95\% of the correlation energy in the given basis but require the Coulomb and exchange operators with up to two-external indices to be stored on disk. Both variants have comparable computational efficiency. The convergence of the results with respect to the natural orbital truncation parameter (T(CutPNO)) has been studied. Extended numerical tests have been performed on absolute and relative correlation energies as function of basis set size and T(CutPNO) as well as on reaction energies, isomerization energies, and weak intermolecular interactions. The results indicate that the errors of the LPNO methods compared to the canonical QCISD and CCSD methods are below 1 kcal/mol with our default thresholds. Finally, some calculations on larger molecules are reported (ranging from 40-86 atoms) and it is shown that for medium sized molecules the total wall clock time required to complete the LPNO-CCSD calculations is only two to four times that of the preceding self-consistent field (SCF). Thus these methods are highly suitable for large-scale computational chemistry applications. Since there are only three thresholds involved that have been given conservative default values, the methods can be confidentially used in a "black-box" fashion in the same way as their canonical counterparts.},

abstract = {Spectroscopic studies of light harvesting and the subsequent energy conversion in photosynthesis can track quantum dynamics happening on the microscopic level. The Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex of the photosynthetic green sulfur bacteria Chlorobium tepidum is a prototype efficient light-harvesting antenna: it stores the captured photon energy in the form of excitons (collective excitations), which are subsequently converted to chemical energy with almost 100\% efficiency. These excitons show an elaborate relaxation pattern involving coherent and incoherent pathways. We make use of the complex chirality and fundamental symmetries of multidimensional optical signals to design new sequences of ultrashort laser pulses that can distinguish between coherent quantum oscillations and incoherent energy dissipation during the exciton relaxation. The cooperative dynamical features, which reflect the coherent nature of excitations, are amplified. The extent of quantum oscillations and their timescales in photosynthesis can be readily extracted from the designed signals, showing that cooperativity is maintained during energy transport in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. The proposed pulse sequences may also be applied to reveal information on the robustness of quantum states in the presence of fluctuating environments in other nanoscopic complexes and devices.},

@article{Petrov2002,
abstract = {Donor−acceptor electron transfer (D−A ET) through a linear molecular bridge is studied for the particular case of large electronic couplings among the molecular fragments inside the bridge. This makes it possible to choose a description in terms of extended bridge states, whereas the weak coupling of the bridge levels to the D and A centers guarantees the individuality of these terminal sites. Since fast vibrational relaxation within the D and A centers as well as within the system of bridge levels is provided, we can utilize our recently developed coarse graining description of ET (Petrov et al., J. Chem. Phys. 2001, 115, 7107). In particular, it is demonstrated that the whole ET process can be reduced to single-exponential kinetics for the electronic level populations characterized by an effective D−A transfer rate. This rate contains contributions from the overall superexchange and the overall thermally activated rate. The ratio of both contributions is calculated in the framework of the Song and Marcus model valid for a vibrational spectral density describing a single active vibrational mode. Taking reasonable parameters for the D−A ET reaction, it is demonstrated that the thermally activated mechanism can dominate the superexchange ET, even though the population of the bridge by the transferred electron is extremely small. And this dominance increases with increasing bridge length. Drawing the overall ET rate versus the number of bridge units, a novel behavior is predicted. First there is a strong decay of the rate up to a certain bridge length. But it is followed by a remarkable increase which is continued by a modest further increase or an in dependence on the bridge length. Furthermore, simple analytic expressions are given to decide which mechanism may work in a given experiment. Finally, it is underlined that ET pathways along hydrogen bonds or the key amino acids in proteins are extremely favorable for the thermally activated mechanism, while the pathways along covalent bonds are generally realized via the superexchange mechanism even at a small energy gap.},

@article{Renger2010,
abstract = {This Minireview summarizes our current knowledge of the optical properties of photosystem II (PS-II) and how these properties are related to the photosynthetic function, that is, excitation energy transfer from the antenna complexes to the reaction center (RC) and the subsequent transmembrane charge separation in the latter. Interpretation of the optical spectra of PS-II is much more difficult than for the RC of purple bacteria, due to the "spectral congestion" problem, namely, the strong spectral overlap of optical bands in PS-II. Recent developments in deciphering the optical properties of the pigments in PS-II, the identification of functional states, and the kinetic details of the primary excitation energy and charge-transfer reactions are summarized. The spectroscopic term P(680) that is generally used in the literature no longer indicates the same entity in its cationic and singlet excited form but different subsets of the six innermost pigments of the RC. The accessory chlorophyll Chl(D1) forms a sink for singlet excitation and triplet energy and most likely represents the primary electron donor in PS-II. In this respect, a special chlorophyll monomer in PS-II plays the role of the special pair in purple bacteria. Evidence that exciton transfer between the core antenna complexes CP43 and CP47 and the RC is the bottleneck for the overall photochemical trapping of excitation energy in PS-II is discussed. A short summary is provided of PS-II of Acaryochloris marina, which mainly contains chlorophyll d instead of the usual chlorophyll a. This system does not suffer from the spectral congestion problem and, therefore, represents an interesting model system. The final part of this Minireview provides a discussion of challenging problems to be solved in the future.},

@article{Freiberg2013,
abstract = {Live cells and regular crystals seem fundamentally incompatible. Still, effects characteristic to ideal crystals, such as coherent sharing of excitation, have been recently used in many studies to explain the behavior of several photosynthetic complexes, especially the inner workings of the light-harvesting apparatus of the oldest known photosynthetic organisms, the purple bacteria. To this date, there has been no concrete evidence that the same effects are instrumental in real living cells, leaving a possibility that this is an artifact of unnatural study conditions, not a real effect relevant to the biological operation of bacteria. Hereby, we demonstrate survival of collective coherent excitations (excitons) in intact cells of photosynthetic purple bacteria. This is done by using excitation anisotropy spectroscopy for tracking the temperature-dependent evolution of exciton bands in light-harvesting systems of increasing structural complexity. The temperature was gradually raised from 4.5 K to ambient temperature, and the complexity of the systems ranged from detergent-isolated complexes to complete bacterial cells. The results provide conclusive evidence that excitons are indeed one of the key elements contributing to the energetic and dynamic properties of photosynthetic organisms.},

This is the first direct experimental determination of this parameter; it is within the range of values found in previously published calculations. The 1C3PEPS signal of the Qy band of the bacteriochlorophyll B shows that it is weakly coupled to nuclear motions of the bath, whereas the 1C3PEPS signal of the Qy band of the bacteriopheophytin, H, shows that it is more strongly coupled to the bath, but has minimal inhomogeneous broadening.

@article{Skourtis2013,
abstract = {Central to the view of electron-transfer reactions is the idea that nuclear motion generates a transition state geometry at which the electron/hole amplitude propagates coherently from the electron donor to the electron acceptor. In the weakly coupled or nonadiabatic regime, the electron amplitude tunnels through an electronic barrier between the donor and acceptor. The structure of the barrier is determined by the covalent and noncovalent interactions of the bridge. Because the tunneling barrier depends on the nuclear coordinates of the reactants (and on the surrounding medium), the tunneling barrier is highly anisotropic, and it is useful to identify particular routes, or pathways, along which the transmission amplitude propagates. Moreover, when more than one such pathway exists, and the paths give rise to comparable transmission amplitude magnitudes, one may expect to observe quantum interferences among pathways if the propagation remains coherent. Given that the effective tunneling barrier height and width are affected by the nuclear positions, the modulation of the nuclear coordinates will lead to a modulation of the tunneling barrier and hence of the electron flow. For long distance electron transfer in biological and biomimetic systems, nuclear fluctuations, arising from flexible protein moieties and mobile water bridges, can become quite significant. We discuss experimental and theoretical results that explore the quantum interferences among coupling pathways in electron-transfer kinetics; we emphasize recent data and theories associated with the signatures of chirality and inelastic processes, which are manifested in the tunneling pathway coherence (or absence of coherence).},

The photostability of QDs is found to improve dramatically at low repetition rates, allowing for prolonged optical saturation of QDs without apparent photodamage. This observation suggests that QD blinking is facilitated by absorption of light in a transient state with a microsecond decay time. Enhanced photostability of generic quantum dots under intense illumination opens up new prospects for fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy.},

abstract = {Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy of solution-phase mixtures of colloidal CdS quantum dots (QDs) with acid-derivatized viologen molecules, N-[1-heptyl],N'-[3-carboxypropyl]-4,4'-bipyridinium dihexafluorophosphate (V(2+)), indicates electron transfer occurs from the conduction band of the QD to the LUMO of V(2+) after photoexcitation of a band-edge exciton in the QD. Analysis of the magnitude of the ground state bleach of the QD as a function of the molar ratio QD:V(2+) yields the QD-ligand adsorption constant, K(a) (4.4 × 10(4) M(-1)) for V(2+) ligands adsorbed in geometries conducive to electron transfer. The value of K(a), together with the measured rates of (i) formation of the V(+•) electron transfer product and (ii) recovery of the ground state bleach of the QD, enables determination of the intrinsic rate constant for charge separation, k(CS,int) \~{} 1.7 × 10(10) s(-1), the rate for a single QD-V(2+) donor-acceptor pair. This analysis confirms previous reports that the number of ligands adsorbed to each QD is well-described by a Poisson distribution. This is the first report where the QD-ligand charge transfer and binding equilibria are quantitatively investigated simultaneously with a single technique.},

abstract = {Absorption spectra related to heterogeneous electron transfer are analyzed with the focus on direct charge transfer transition from the surface attached molecule into the semiconductor band states. The computations are based on a model of reduced dimensionality with a single intramolecular vibrational coordinate but a complete account for the continuum of conduction band states. The applicability of this model to perylene on TiO2 has been demonstrated in a series of earlier papers. Here, based on a time-dependent formulation, the absorbance is calculated with the inclusion of charge transfer excitations. A broad parameter set inspired by the perylene TiO2 systems is considered. In particular, the description generalizes the Fano effect to heterogeneous electron transfer reactions. Preliminary simulations of measured spectra are presented for perylene-catechol attached to TiO2.},

abstract = {By using bifunctional surface modifiers (SH-R-COOH), CdSe quantum dots (QDs) have been assembled onto mesoscopic TiO(2) films. Upon visible light excitation, CdSe QDs inject electrons into TiO(2) nanocrystallites. Femtosecond transient absorption as well as emission quenching experiments confirm the injection from the excited state of CdSe QDs into TiO(2) nanoparticles. Electron transfer from the thermally relaxed s-state occurs over a wide range of rate constant values between 7.3 x 10(9) and 1.95 x 10(11) s(-1). The injected charge carriers in a CdSe-modified TiO(2) film can be collected at a conducting electrode to generate a photocurrent. The TiO(2)-CdSe composite, when employed as a photoanode in a photoelectrochemical cell, exhibits a photon-to-charge carrier generation efficiency of 12\%. Significant loss of electrons occurs due to scattering as well as charge recombination at TiO(2)/CdSe interfaces and internal TiO(2) grain boundaries.},

abstract = {It has been proved that fullerene derivatives, in which an oligophenylenevinylene (OPV) group is attached to C60, present an interesting photophysical phenomenon and can be incorporated into photovoltaic cells. In these systems, the OPV acts as electron donor upon excitation, and then fullerene absorbs photoexcited electrons. These new organic semiconductor materials offer the prospect of lower manufacturing costs and they present several advantages: easy fabrication, large area, flexible and light weight devices when compared with inorganic counter parts. In the present theoretical study, oligomeric chains of p-phenylenevinylene (n-PPV, n 5 3–8 units) and C60- OPV hybrids have been studied by density functional theory (DFT). Electronic properties such as electronic absorp- tion and emission spectra were calculated in order to determinate how the increment of spectroscopic units affects their electronic behavior. These properties were carried out with time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT) and ZINDO semiempirical method. The theoretical calculations of the structural properties of n-PPV and fullerene- OPV hybrids were obtained using PBE1PBE/6-31G and ONIOM two-layered version, respectively. All calculations were done with Gaussian 03W program package.},

abstract = {The dephasing of PbS quantum dots has been carefully measured using three pulse four-wave mixing and two-dimensional nonlinear optical spectroscopy. The temperature dependence of the homogeneous linewidth obtained from the two-dimensional spectra indicates significant scattering by acoustic phonons, whereas the excitation density dependence shows negligible excitation induced broadening in agreement with previous results. The rapid dephasing is attributed to elastic scattering by acoustic phonons. However, two dephasing components emerge, the short component that dominates the decay and a weaker longer decay, likely due to “zero-phonon” dephasing. Quantum beats originating from two separate states can be observed, possibly revealing an ∼23.6 meV splitting of the excitonic ground state. Finally, the emergence of biexcitonic effects enhanced by the high quantum confinement is discussed.},

abstract = {The resistance of a conductor measured in a four-probe setup is invariant if the exchange of the voltage and current sources is accompanied by a magnetic field reversal. We present a derivation of this theorm. The reciprocity of the resistances is lined directly to the microscopic reciprocity of the S-matrix, which describes reflection at the sample and transmission through the sample. We demonstrate that this symmetry holds for a conductor with an arbitrary number of leads. Since leads act like inelastic scatterers, consideration of a many-probe conductor also implies that the reciprocity of resistances is valid in the presence of inelastic scattering. Vairious conductance formulate are discussed in the light of the reciprocity theorem. Finally, we discuss some implications of our results for the nature of a voltage measurement and point to the difference between chemical potentials and the local electric potential.},

abstract = {Decay of excited state absorption, owing to charge injection into the conduction band continuum of semiconductor states, is obtained via a qualitative theoretical model. The density matrix formalism is utilized to obtain an expression for the sequential pump−probe signal in terms of the nonlinear third-order polarization of the molecular system. Electron transfer slower than the pump and probe pulses is assumed and reorganization of the molecule upon charge injection is ignored while obtaining the final expressions. The lifetime of the excited state decouples from nuclear motion as a consequence. Decay of the excited state into a continuum of electronic states is examined for various energy positions of the injecting state and for different bandwidths of the continuum. The decay can be fitted by exponential functions for the majority of the cases considering different dimensionalities of the semiconductor continuum. Model calculations are performed for the snapshot limit of the pump−probe signal. Under the assumed conditions one obtains oscillations due to vibronic coherences that are superimposed on temperature-independent irreversible charge transfer decays, as is reported in recent experiments.},

Our general analysis of 2D double-quantum coherence resonances has demonstrated that the interband Coulomb interactions lead to new cross-peaks whose appearance can be interpreted as a result of exciton and biexciton state mixing. The presence of the strongly coupled resonant states and weakly coupled background of off-resonant states can significantly simplify cross-peak analysis by eliminating the congested background spectrum. Our simulations of the 2D double-quantum coherence signal in PbSe NCs have validated this approach.},

abstract = {The observation of long-lived electronic coherence in photosynthetic excitation energy transfer (EET) by Engel et al. [Nature (London) 446, 782 (2007)] raises questions about the role of the protein environment in protecting this coherence and the significance of the quantum coherence in light harvesting efficiency. In this paper we explore the applicability of the Redfield equation in its full form, in the secular approximation and with neglect of the imaginary part of the relaxation terms for the study of these phenomena. We find that none of the methods can give a reliable picture of the role of the environment in photosynthetic EET. In particular the popular secular approximation (or the corresponding Lindblad equation) produces anomalous behavior in the incoherent transfer region leading to overestimation of the contribution of environment-assisted transfer. The full Redfield expression on the other hand produces environment-independent dynamics in the large reorganization energy region. A companion paper presents an improved approach, which corrects these deficiencies [A. Ishizaki and G. R. Fleming, J. Chem. Phys. 130, 234111 (2009)].},

The transient spectra show the presence of bleaching of absorption for the 1Sh−1Se transition, as well as transients associated with the 1Ph−1Pe transition. We examine signatures of carrier multiplication (multiple excitons arising from a single absorbed photon) from analysis of the bleaching features in the limit of low absorbed photon numbers (⟨Nabs⟩ ∼ 10−2) for pump photon energies from two to four times that of the band gap. The efficiency of multiple-exciton generation is discussed both in terms of the ratio between early- to long-time transient absorption signals and of a broadband global fit to the data. Analysis of the population dynamics shows that bleaching associated with biexciton population is red shifted with respect to the single exciton feature, which is in accordance with a positive binding energy for the biexciton.},

In this work, we use a combination of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2D-ES), pump-probe measurements, and quantum chemistry to investigate the ultrafast CT dynamics in a lutetium bisphthalocyanine dimer in different oxidation states. It is found that in the anionic form, the combination of strong CT-exciton interaction and electronic asymmetry induced by a counter-ion enables CT between the two macrocycles of the complex on a 30 fs timescale. Following optical excitation, a chain of electron and hole transfer steps gives rise to characteristic cross-peak dynamics in the electronic 2D spectra, and we monitor how the excited state charge density ultimately localizes on the macrocycle closest to the counter-ion within 100 fs. A comparison with the dynamics in the radical species further elucidates how CT states modulate the electronic structure and tune fs-reaction dynamics. Our experiments demonstrate the unique capability of 2D-ES in combination with other methods to decipher ultrafast CT dynamics.},

The effects of environmental decoherence and relaxation on the electron transfer rate are investigated for several types of decoherence processes. The rate as a function of decoherence amplitude shows Kramers turnover, as expected. However, various decoherence processes affect the quantum interference differently. It is shown that when the bridge sites are not dephased the superexchange transfer is enhanced by constructive quantum interference. Dephasing on bridge sites opens a (classical) diffusive channel for fast electron transfer, which can dominate the superexchange current and reduce the constructive quantum interference.},

abstract = {The rate of intramolecular charge transfer from biphenyl to naphthalene was determined for the radical anions and radical cations of molecules with the general structure: (2-naphthyl)-(steroid spacer)-(4-biphenylyl). Varied degrees of unsaturation (one double bond, NSenB; two double bonds, NSen(2)B; and the b-ring completely aromatized, NSarB) were incorporated into the steroid spacer to examine the effect it would have on the charge transfer rate. The charge transfer rate, as inferred from the decay of the biphenyl radical ion absorption, increased in all cases relative to the completely saturated 3-(2-naphthyl)-16-(4-biphenylyl)-5alpha-androstane (NSB) reference molecule. For the anion charge transfer, the decay rates increased by factors of 1.4, 4.2, and 5.1, respectively, and for the cation, the decay rates increased by factors of 5, 276, and 470. To explain the results, the charge-transfer process was viewed as a combination of two independent mechanisms: a single-step, superexchange mechanism, and a two-step, sequential charge transfer. Using a low level of theory, simple models of the superexchange and two-step mechanisms were developed to elucidate the nature and differences between the two mechanisms. The critical variable for this analysis is the free energy of formation (DeltaG(I) degrees ) of the intermediate state: (2-naphthyl)-[spacer](1)+/--(4-biphenylyl). The conclusion from this treatment is that superexchange is the dominant mechanism when DeltaG(I) degrees is large, but at small DeltaG(I) degrees , the sequential mechanism will dominate. This is because the superexchange rate is shown to have a weak dependence on DeltaG(I) degrees , changing 10-fold for a change in DeltaG(I) degrees of 2 eV, compared to the sequential mechanism in which the rate can change over 10(3) for 0.5 V.},

We measure the temperature and excitation-density dependence of the exciton ground-state homogeneous lineshape of quantum dots within the ensemble and show that acoustic phonon sidebands are absent. The linewidth increases nonlinearly with temperature from 6 to 50 K and the behavior is well-described by an Arrhenius equation with an offset. The absence of a phonon-activation peak in the spectra reveals that elastic exciton-phonon scattering is the primary dephasing mechanism and the results can be explained qualitatively using an extension of the independent Bosonmodel that includes quadratic coupling in the phonon displacement coordinates. At temperatures ≥ 35 K, spectral features associated with phonon-assisted population transfer of excitons out of the quantum dots and into quantum wells states begin to appear.},

abstract = {We report a first-principles study on the evolu- tion of nonequilibrium charge transport in a two-terminal molecular-scale device with the increase in the length of the molecular wire built out of cubane oligomers. In particular, for wires of three different lengths, we look into the relative contribution of the “in-phase” and the “out-of-phase” compo- nents of the total electronic current under the influence of an external bias. In the low-bias regime, the “out-of-phase” con- tribution to the total current is minimal and the “in-phase” elastic tunneling of the electrons is responsible for the net electronic current. This is true, irrespective of the length of the molecular spacer. In this regime, the currentvoltage charac- teristics followOhm’s law and the conductance of the wires is found to decrease exponentially with the increase in length, which is in agreement with experimental results. However, after a certain “offset” voltage, the current increases nonlinearly with bias and the “out-of-phase” tunneling of electrons reduces the current substantially. This behavior is attributed to the reduction in constructive interference due to phase randomization at the resonant tunneling regime, and thus, the height of the transmission peak is reduced. Wesubsequently studied the interaction of conduction electrons with the vibrational modes as a function of external bias in the three different oligomers since they are one of the main sources of phase-breaking scattering. The number of vibrational modes that couple strongly with the electronic levels is found to increase with the length of the spacer, which is consistent with the existence of the lowest “offset” voltage for the longest wire under study.},

We consider two qualitatively different model Hamiltonians representing the limits of desorption induced by a single and by multiple electronic transitions and at the same time the limits of resonance-mediated and direct nuclear dynamics. The photodesorption probability of NH3/Cu induced by low-intensity, nanosecond pulses is dominated by a resonant component and determined by the competition of desorption with vibrational relaxation. The probability is linear in the excitation intensity but highly nonlinear in the nonradiative coupling. The photodesorption of NO/Pd induced by intense, femtosecond pulses involves complex electronic dynamics and its vibrational dynamics is mostly direct. Multiple transitions to an ionic state are shown formally and numerically. These give rise to several thresholds in the time-resolved desorption probability. A power-law fluence dependence is found, consistent with observations.},

This article discusses strategies for accounting for uncertainties and heterogeneities when using Marcus theory to interpret rates of PCS in QD−organic complexes and highlights how measurement of PCS rates can provide information about the interfacial structure of the QD surface.

The mechanical properties of the nanojunction formed by this molecular species sandwiched between gold cluster pyramids mimicking metallic electrodes were determined. The thermodynamics of the reduction reaction was studied on the disulfide bridge as well as on the potentially competing anchoring sulfur atoms. A highly favorable product ratio toward the disulfide bridge reduction was found. Conductance values were calculated by means of non-equilibrium Green functions techniques. Interestingly, a significant difference between the closed (high conductance) and opened (low conductance) species was found.},

These include the extent to which a pure state can be created out of a statistical ensemble, the degree to which control theory can develop superposition states that resist dissipation, and the nature of environments that prohibits control. Our results illustrate the information content of control studies regarding the dissipative properties of the bath and point to the strategies that optimize different targets in wavepacket alignment in nonideal environments. As an interesting aside, the method is used to illustrate the limit where the coherence-based approach to molecular alignment converges to traditional incoherent approaches.},

abstract = {We describe the structural, optical, and electrical properties of films of spin-cast, oleate-capped PbSe nanocrystals that are treated thermally or chemically in solutions of hydrazine, methylamine, or pyridine to produce electronically coupled nanocrystal solids. Postdeposition heat treatments trigger nanocrystal sintering at approximately 200 degrees C, before a substantial fraction of the oleate capping group evaporates or pyrolyzes. The sintered nanocrystal films have a large hole density and are highly conductive. Most of the amine treatments preserve the size of the nanocrystals and remove much of the oleate, decreasing the separation between nanocrystals and yielding conductive films. X-ray scattering, X-ray photoelectron and optical spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and field-effect transistor electrical measurements are used to compare the impact of these chemical treatments. We find that the concentration of amines adsorbed to the NC films is very low in all cases. Treatments in hydrazine in acetonitrile remove only 2-7\% of the oleate yet result in high-mobility n-type transistors. In contrast, ethanol-based hydrazine treatments remove 85-90\% of the original oleate load. Treatments in pure ethanol strip 20\% of the oleate and create conductive p-type transistors. Methylamine- and pyridine-treated films are also p-type. These chemically treated films oxidize rapidly in air to yield, after short air exposures, highly conductive p-type nanocrystal solids. Our results aid in the rational development of solar cells based on colloidal nanocrystal films.},

Using the CIS(D) ap- proximation as a test model, we find that the number of double excitation amplitudes can be reduced dramatically with minor impact on the accuracy if the excited state wavefunction is expanded in state-specific PNOs generated from an approximate first-order guess wavefunction. As for ground states, the PNO truncation error can also for excitation energies be controlled by a single threshold related to generalized natural occupation numbers. The best performance is found with occupied or- bitals which are localized by the Pipek-Mezey localization. For a large test set of excited states we find with this localization that already a PNO threshold of 10−8–10−7, corresponding to an average of only 40–80 PNOs per pair, is sufficient to keep the PNO truncation error for vertical excitation energies below 0.01 eV. This is a significantly more rapid convergence with the number doubles amplitudes than in domain-based local response approaches. We demonstrate that the number of significant excited state PNOs scales asymptotically linearly with the system size in the worst case of completely delocalized excitations and sub-linearly whenever the chromophore does not increase with the system size. Moreover, we observe that the flexibility of state-specific PNOs to adapt to the character of an excitation allows for an almost unbiased treatment of local, delocalized and charge transfer excited states.},

abstract = {Photosynthesis, the process by which energy from sunlight drives cellular metabolism, relies on a unique organization of light-harvesting and reaction center complexes. Recently, the organization of light-harvesting LH2 complexes and dimeric reaction center-light-harvesting I-PufX core complexes in membranes of purple non-sulfur bacteria was revealed by atomic force microscopy [S. Bahatyrova et al., Nature (London) 430, 1058 (2004)]. Here, we discuss optimal exciton transfer in a biomimetic system closely modeled on the structure of LH2 and its organization within the membrane using a Markovian quantum model with dissipation and trapping added phenomenologically. In a deliberate manner, we neglect the high level detail of the bacterial light-harvesting complex and its interaction with the phonon bath in order to elucidate a set of design principles that may be incorporated in artificial pigment-scaffold constructs in a supramolecular assembly. We show that our scheme reproduces many of the most salient features found in their natural counterpart and may be largely explained by simple electrostatic considerations. Most importantly, we show that quantum effects act primarily to enforce robustness with respect to spatial and spectral disorder between and within complexes. The implications of such an arrangement are discussed in the context of biomimetic photosynthetic analogs capable of transferring energy efficiently across tens to hundreds of nanometers.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to better understand the history, physical examination, imaging, and outcome of arthroscopic debridement of acetabular labral tears. We performed a review of all 290 patients who underwent hip arthroscopy at our institution to identify those who have undergone arthroscopic debridement of an acetabular labral tear. Patients were assessed at follow-up by a physician visit or telephone interview and questioned as to pain, mechanical symptoms, activity level, work status, sports ability, and performance of activities of daily living. Patients were followed-up for a minimum of 1 year or until they underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA). All 28 patients meeting the study criteria were available for follow-up (mean age, 41 years; range, 14 to 70 years) at an average of 34 months after surgery (range, 13 to 100 months). Average duration of symptoms before arthroscopy was 25 months. Eighteen (64\%) patients were noted to have mechanical symptoms such as clicking or locking. Ten patients were noted to have a specific inciting event that initiated their symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging identified the labral tear in 5 of 21 (24\%) cases; arthrography identified the tear in 1 of 8 (13\%). Of the 28 tears identified, there were 12 radial flap, 5 degenerative, 5 bucket handle, 3 horizontal cleavage, and 3 peripheral longitudinal tears. Seventeen were located anteriorly, 7 were located posteriorly, and 4 were located superiorly. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the presence of significant joint arthritis on radiographs. Of those without arthritis, 10 of 14 (71\%) had good to excellent results, and 2 patients underwent total hip arthroplasty at an average of 52 months after surgery. Of those with arthritis, 3 of 14 (21\%) had good to excellent results, and 6 patients underwent THA at an average of 14 months after surgery. There were three cases of complications consisting of nerve palsies (two sciatic, one pudendal) that resolved completely without any remaining functional or sensory deficits.},

abstract = {An electronic friction approach based on Langevin dynamics is used to describe the multidimensional (six-dimensional) dynamics of femtosecond laser induced desorption of H(2) and D(2) from a H(D)-covered Ru(0001) surface. The paper extends previous reduced-dimensional models, using a similar approach. In the present treatment forces and frictional coefficients are calculated from periodic density functional theory (DFT) and essentially parameter-free, while the action of femtosecond laser pulses on the metal surface is treated by using the two-temperature model. Our calculations shed light on the performance and validity of various adiabatic, non-adiabatic, and Arrhenius/Kramers type kinetic models to describe hot-electron mediated photoreactions at metal surfaces. The multidimensional frictional dynamics are able to reproduce and explain known experimental facts, such as strong isotope effects, scaling of properties with laser fluence, and non-equipartitioning of vibrational, rotational, and translational energies of desorbing species. Further, detailed predictions regarding translations are made, and the question for the controllability of photoreactions at surfaces with the help of vibrational preexcitation is addressed.},

abstract = {A general framework is presented to describe a resonant inelastic current inducing dynamics in the nuclear degrees of freedom of a molecule embedded between two electrodes. This approach makes use of the scattering theory of density matrices to account for the interaction between the scattering charge and the molecular modes to all orders and reduces in appropriate limits to both the standard master equation treatment for vibrational heating and the Landauer formalism for purely elastic transport. While the method presented here is equivalent to these approaches in limiting cases, it also goes well beyond their restrictions by incorporating the full quantum dynamics in the vibrational subspace in the presence of tunneling current. By application to the Au-C(60)-Au junction, it is shown that inclusion of vibrational coherences, which were previously neglected, is crucial to accurately predict the dynamics induced by current in molecular devices. Interaction with a bath of phonon modes is incorporated within the Bloch model and the competition between the bath-induced relaxation processes and the current-induced excitation is studied in detail over a range of temperatures.},

abstract = {Ab initio DFT molecular dynamics simulations are combined with quantum dynamics calculations of electronic relaxation to investigate the interfacial electron transfer in catechol/TiO(2)-anatase nanostructures under vacuum conditions. It is found that the primary process in the interfacial electron-transfer dynamics involves an ultrafast (tau(1) approximately 6 fs) electron-injection event that localizes the charge in the Ti(4+) surface ions next to the catechol adsorbate. The primary event is followed by charge delocalization (i.e., carrier diffusion) through the TiO(2)-anatase crystal, an anisotropic diffusional process that can be up to an order of magnitude slower along the [-101] direction than carrier relaxation along the [010] and [101] directions in the anatase crystal. It is shown that both the mechanism of electron injection and the time scales for interfacial electron transfer are quite sensitive to the symmetry of the electronic state initially populated in the adsorbate molecule. The results are particularly relevant to the understanding of surface charge separation in efficient mechanisms of molecular-based photovoltaic devices.},

abstract = {The broad success of optimally controlling quantum systems with external fields has been attributed to the favorable topology of the underlying control landscape, where the landscape is the physical observable as a function of the controls. The control landscape can be shown to contain no suboptimal trapping extrema upon satisfaction of reasonable physical assumptions, but this topological analysis does not hold when significant constraints are placed on the control resources. This work employs simulations to explore the topology and features of the control landscape for pure-state population transfer with a constrained class of control fields. The fields are parameterized in terms of a set of uniformly spaced spectral frequencies, with the associated phases acting as the controls. This restricted family of fields provides a simple illustration for assessing the impact of constraints upon seeking optimal control. Optimization results reveal that the minimum number of phase controls necessary to assure a high yield in the target state has a special dependence on the number of accessible energy levels in the quantum system, revealed from an analysis of the first- and second-order variation of the yield with respect to the controls. When an insufficient number of controls and/or a weak control fluence are employed, trapping extrema and saddle points are observed on the landscape. When the control resources are sufficiently flexible, solutions producing the globally maximal yield are found to form connected "level sets" of continuously variable control fields that preserve the yield. These optimal yield level sets are found to shrink to isolated points on the top of the landscape as the control field fluence is decreased, and further reduction of the fluence turns these points into suboptimal trapping extrema on the landscape. Although constrained control fields can come in many forms beyond the cases explored here, the behavior found in this paper is illustrative of the impacts that constraints can introduce.},

abstract = {The quantum dot, one of the central materials in nanoscience, is a semiconductor crystal with a physical size on the nanometer length scale. It is often called an "artificial atom" because researchers can create nanostructures which yield properties similar to those of real atoms. By virtue of having a size in between molecules and solids, the quantum dot offers a rich palette for exploring new science and developing novel technologies. Although the physical structure of quantum dots is well known, a clear understanding of the resultant electronic structure and dynamics has remained elusive. However, because the electronic structure and dynamics of the dot, the "excitonics", confer its function in devices such as solar cells, lasers, LEDs, and nonclassical photon sources, a more complete understanding of these properties is critical for device development. In this Account, we use colloidal CdSe dots as a test bed upon which to explore four select issues in excitonic processes in quantum dots. We have developed a state-resolved spectroscopic approach which has yielded precise measurements of the electronic structural dynamics of quantum dots and has made inroads toward creating a unified picture of many of the key dynamic processes in these materials. We focus on four main topics of longstanding interest and controversy: (i) hot exciton relaxation dynamics, (ii) multiexcitons, (iii) optical gain, and (iv) exciton-phonon coupling. Using this state-resolved approach, we reconcile long standing controversies related to phenomena such as exciton cooling and exciton-phonon coupling and make surprising new observations related to optical gain and multiexcitons.},

abstract = {T he transport of charge via electrons and the transport of excitation energy via excitons are two processes of fun- damental importance in diverse areas of research. Charac- terization of electron transfer (ET) and excitation energy transfer (EET) rates are essential for a full understanding of, for instance, biological systems (such as respiration and pho- tosynthesis) and opto-electronic devices (which interconvert electric and light energy). In this Account, we examine one of the parameters, the electronic coupling factor, for which reli- able values are critical in determining transfer rates. Although ET and EET are different processes, many strategies for cal- culating the couplings share common themes. We empha- size the similarities in basic assumptions between the computational methods for the ET and EET couplings, exam- ine the differences, and summarize the properties, advan- tages, and limits of the different computational methods. The electronic coupling factor is an off-diagonal Hamil- tonian matrix element between the initial and final dia- batic states in the transport processes. ET coupling is essentially the interaction of the two molecular orbitals (MOs) where the electron occupancy is changed. Singlet excitation energy transfer (SEET), however, contains a Fo¨ rster dipole-dipole coupling as its most important constituent. Triplet excitation energy transfer (TEET) involves an exchange of two electrons of different spin and energy; thus, it is like an overlap interaction of two pairs of MOs. Strategies for calculating ET and EET couplings can be classified as (1) energy-gap-based approaches, (2) direct calculation of the off-diagonal matrix elements, or (3) use of an additional operator to describe the extent of charge or excitation localization and to calculate the coupling value. Some of the difficulties in calculating the couplings were recently resolved. Methods were developed to remove the nondynamical correlation problem from the highly precise coupled cluster models for ET coupling. It is now pos- sible to obtain reliable ET couplings from entry-level excited-state Hamiltonians. A scheme to calculate the EET cou- pling in a general class of systems, regardless of the contributing terms, was also developed. In the past, empirically derived parameters were heavily invoked in model description of charge and excitation energy drifts in a solid-state device. Recent advances, including the methods described in this Account, permit the first- principle quantum mechanical characterization of one class of the parameters in such descriptions, enhancing the pre- dictive power and allowing a deeper understanding of the systems involved.},

abstract = {Generally, rotational isomerization about the carbon-carbon single bond in simple ethane derivatives in room-temperature solution under thermal equilibrium conditions has been too fast to measure. We achieved this goal using two-dimensional infrared vibrational echo spectroscopy to observe isomerization between the gauche and trans conformations of an ethane derivative, 1-fluoro-2-isocyanato-ethane (1), in a CCl4 solution at room temperature. The isomerization time constant is 43 picoseconds (ps, 10(-12) s). Based on this value and on density functional theory calculations of the barrier heights of 1, n-butane, and ethane, the time constants for n-butane and ethane internal rotation under the same conditions are approximately 40 and approximately 12 ps, respectively.},

@article{Rego2005,
abstract = {Functionalization of semiconductor nanocrystals can be achieved by anchoring organic ligands to the surface dangling bonds. The resulting surface complexes often introduce electronic states in the semiconductor band gap. These interband states sensitize the host material for photoabsorption at frequencies characteristic of the molecular adsorbates, leading to the well-known process of photoexcitation and subsequent femtosecond interfacial electron transfer. This paper investigates the relaxation dynamics of hole states, energetically localized deep in the semiconductor band gap, after the ultrafast electron-hole pair separation due to interfacial electron transfer. Mixed quantum-classical methods, based on mean-field nuclear dynamics approximated by ab initio density functional theory molecular dynamics simulations, reveal superexchange hole tunneling between adjacent adsorbate molecules in a model study of functionalized TiO2-anatase nanostructures. It is shown that electronic coherences can persist for hundreds of picoseconds under cryogenic and vacuum conditions, despite the partial intrinsic decoherence induced by thermal ionic motion, providing results of broad theoretical and experimental interest.},

@article{Riplinger2013,
abstract = {In previous publications, it was shown that an efficient local coupled cluster method with single- and double excitations can be based on the concept of pair natural orbitals (PNOs) [F. Neese, A. Hansen, and D. G. Liakos, J. Chem. Phys. 131, 064103 (2009)]. The resulting local pair natural orbital-coupled-cluster single double (LPNO-CCSD) method has since been proven to be highly reliable and efficient. For large molecules, the number of amplitudes to be determined is reduced by a factor of 10(5)-10(6) relative to a canonical CCSD calculation on the same system with the same basis set. In the original method, the PNOs were expanded in the set of canonical virtual orbitals and single excitations were not truncated. This led to a number of fifth order scaling steps that eventually rendered the method computationally expensive for large molecules (e.g., >100 atoms). In the present work, these limitations are overcome by a complete redesign of the LPNO-CCSD method. The new method is based on the combination of the concepts of PNOs and projected atomic orbitals (PAOs). Thus, each PNO is expanded in a set of PAOs that in turn belong to a given electron pair specific domain. In this way, it is possible to fully exploit locality while maintaining the extremely high compactness of the original LPNO-CCSD wavefunction. No terms are dropped from the CCSD equations and domains are chosen conservatively. The correlation energy loss due to the domains remains below <0.05\%, which implies typically 15-20 but occasionally up to 30 atoms per domain on average. The new method has been given the acronym DLPNO-CCSD ("domain based LPNO-CCSD"). The method is nearly linear scaling with respect to system size. The original LPNO-CCSD method had three adjustable truncation thresholds that were chosen conservatively and do not need to be changed for actual applications. In the present treatment, no additional truncation parameters have been introduced. Any additional truncation is performed on the basis of the three original thresholds. There are no real-space cutoffs. Single excitations are truncated using singles-specific natural orbitals. Pairs are prescreened according to a multipole expansion of a pair correlation energy estimate based on local orbital specific virtual orbitals (LOSVs). Like its LPNO-CCSD predecessor, the method is completely of black box character and does not require any user adjustments. It is shown here that DLPNO-CCSD is as accurate as LPNO-CCSD while leading to computational savings exceeding one order of magnitude for larger systems. The largest calculations reported here featured >8800 basis functions and >450 atoms. In all larger test calculations done so far, the LPNO-CCSD step took less time than the preceding Hartree-Fock calculation, provided no approximations have been introduced in the latter. Thus, based on the present development reliable CCSD calculations on large molecules with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy are realized.},

abstract = {We have performed ultrafast absorption bleach recovery and fluorescence upconversion measurements ( approximately 100 fs time resolution) for three CdSe samples, with nanoparticle diameters of 2.7, 2.9, and 4.3 nm. The two types of experiments provide complementary information regarding the contributions of the different processes involved in the fast relaxation of electrons and holes in the CdSe quantum dots. Transient absorption and emission experiments were conducted for the 1S [1Se-1S3/2(h)] transition, 1S(e) and 1S3/2(h) representing the lowest electron (e) and hole (h) levels. The bleach recovery of the 1S transition shows a approximately 400-500 fs initial rise, which is followed by a size-dependent approximately 10-90 ps decay and finally a long-lived (approximately ns) decay. The fluorescence upconversion signal for the 1S transition shows quite different temporal behavior: a two times slower rise time (approximately 700-1000 fs) and, when the fluorescence upconversion signal has risen to about 20\% of its maximum intensity, the signal displays a slight leveling off (bend), followed by a continued rise until the maximum intensity is reached. This bend is well reproducible and power and concentration independent. Simulations show that the bend in the rise is caused by a very fast decay component with a typical time of about 230-430 fs. Considering that the 1S quantum dot excitation is comprised of five exciton substates (F=+/-2, +/-1L, 0L, +/-1U, and 0U), we attribute the disparity in the rise of the bleaching and emission transients to the results from the dynamics of the different excitons involved in respectively the bleaching and fluorescence experiments. More specifically, in transient absorption, population changes of the F=+/-1U excitons are probed, in emission population effects for the F=+/-2 ("dark") and the F=+/-1L ("bright") exciton states are monitored. It is discussed that the fast (approximately 400-500 fs) rise of the bleach recovery is representative of the feeding of the F=+/-1U exciton (by filling of the 1S(e) electron level) and that the slower (approximately 700-1000 fs) feeding of the emissive +/-2, +/-1L excitons is determined by the relaxation of the hole levels within the 1S3/2 fine structure. Finally, the approximately 230-430 fs component, typical of the bend in the fluorescence transient, is attributed to the thermalization of the close-lying +/-2 ("dark") and +/-1L ("bright") excitons.},

A quantitative answer to this question has not been possible due in part to limitations of current experimental techniques in probing hot electron populations. Here we use femtosecond time-resolved two-photon photoemission spectroscopy to carry out a complete mapping in time- and energy-domains of hot electron relaxation and multi-exciton generation (MEG) dynamics in lead selenide quantum dots functionalized with 1,2-ethanedithiols. We find a linear scale law between the hot electron relaxation rate and its energy above the conduction band minimum. There is no evidence of MEG from intra-band hot electron relaxation for excitation photon energy as high as three times the bandgap (3Eg). Rather, MEG occurs in this system only from inter-band hot electron transitions at sufficiently high photon energies (\~{} 4Eg).},

Near-IR TA spectroscopy facilitates charge carrier-resolved analysis of excitonic decay of QDs because signals in the NIR are due exclusively to absorptions of photoexcited electrons and holes, as probe energies in this region are not high enough to induce absorptions across the optical bandgap that crowd the visible TA spectra. The response of each observed component of the excitonic decay to the presence of a hole-trapping ligand (1-octanethiol) and an electron-accepting ligand (1,4-benzoquinone), and comparison of time constants to those for recovery of the ground state bleaching feature in the visible TA spectrum, allow for the assignment of the components to (i) a 1.6 ps hole trapping process, (ii) 19 ps and 274 ps surface-mediated electron trapping processes, and (iii) a ∼5 ns recombination of untrapped electrons.},

abstract = {PbSe is a pseudo-II-VI material distinguished from ordinary II-VI's (e.g., CdSe, ZnSe) by having both its valence band maximum (VBM) and its conduction band minimum (CBM) located at the fourfold-degenerate L-point in the Brillouin zone. It turns out that this feature dramatically affects the properties of the nanosystem. We have calculated the electronic and optical properties of PbSe quantum dots using an atomistic pseudopotential method, finding that the electronic structure is different from that of ordinary II-VI's and, at the same time, is more subtle than what k·p or tight-binding calculations have suggested previously for PbSe. We find the following in PbSe dots: (i) The intraband (valence-to-valence and conduction-to-conduction) as well as interband (valence-to-conduction) excitations involve the massively split L-manifold states. (ii) In contrast to previous suggestions that the spacings between valence band levels will equal those between conduction band levels (because the corresponding effective-masses me ≈ mh are similar), we find a densely spaced hole manifold and much sparser electron manifold. This finding reflects the existence of a few valence band maxima in bulk PbSe within 500 meV. This result reverses previous expectations of slow hole cooling in PbSe dots. (iii) The calculated optical absorption spectrum reproduces the measured absorption peak that had previously been attributed to the forbidden 1Sh → 1Pe or 1Ph → 1Se transitions on the basis of k·p calculations. However, we find that this transition corresponds to an allowed 1Ph → 1Pe excitation arising mainly from bulk states near the L valleys on the $\Gamma$−L lines of the Brillouin zone. We discuss this reinterpretation of numerous experimental results.},

abstract = {Theoretical analysis of nonadiabatic electron-transfer reactions in molecules usually assumes that electron amplitude propagates coherently from the reductant to the oxidant via covalent and noncovalent coupling pathways. We show that when the tunneling electron excites local bridge vibrations (inelastic tunneling), the excitation “labels” the physical pathway traversed. As such, the coherence among the bridge-mediated tunneling pathways is destroyed. We illustrate this effect using a simple model Hamiltonian and show how the donor- acceptor interaction, and thus the electron-transfer rate, is modified by inelastic effects. Pathway coherence loss provides a mechanism to relax orbital-symmetry constraints on electron-transfer reactions. This effect may be of particular significance in macromolecules with destructively interfering pathways or low tunneling barriers. Pathway decoherence that arises from inelastic effects in molecules is analogous to coherence loss in mesoscopic “which way” interferometers and might provide an approach to gate electron flow in molecular- scale devices.},

@article{Shadle2012a,
abstract = {The ability to couple problem solving both to the understanding of chemical concepts and to laboratory practices is an essential skill for undergraduate chemistry programs to foster in our students. Therefore, chemistry programs must offer opportunities to answer real problems that require use of problem-solving processes used by practicing chemists, including those of experimental design. Additionally, programs should assess the extent to which these skills are mastered by students and use the results to inform curricular development. This manuscript describes a rubric for experimental problem solving in chemistry that seeks to assess the extent to which students can both understand a chemical problem and design an instrument-based strategy to address it. The rubric effectively differentiates responses to practicum questions answered by students at different stages of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. The data show that students improve in their ability to problem solve as they progress through the program. On average, students are able to provide a “correct” answer before they are able to articulate a complete understanding of the problem or to justify their choices. The rubric will be useful to others seeking to study or assess student problem-solving skills at both the course and curricular levels.},

We have previously used a simple approach [Adolphs and Renger (2006) Biophys J 91:2778-2797] to study the shift in local transition energies (site energies) of the FMO protein of Prosthecochloris aestuarii by charged amino acid residues, assuming a standard protonation pattern of the titratable groups. Recently, we have found strong evidence that besides the charged amino acids also the neutral charge density of the protein is important, by applying a combined quantum chemical/electrostatic approach [M\"{u}h et al. (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, in press]. Here, we extract the essential parts from this sophisticated method to obtain a relatively simple method again. It is shown that the main contribution to the site energy shifts is due to charge density coupling (CDC) between the pigments and their pigment, protein and water surroundings and that polarization effects for qualitative considerations can be approximated by screening the Coulomb coupling by an effective dielectric constant.},

Nanoconstructs composed of nucleolin-specific aptamers and gold nanostars were actively transported to the nucleus and induced major changes to the nuclear phenotype via nuclear envelope invaginations near the site of the construct. The number of local deformations could be increased by ultrafast, light-triggered release of the aptamers from the surface of the gold nanostars. Cancer cells with more nuclear envelope folding showed increased caspase 3 and 7 activity (apoptosis) as well as decreased cell viability. This newly revealed correlation between drug-induced changes in nuclear phenotype and increased therapeutic efficacy could provide new insight for nuclear-targeted cancer therapy.},

Here we study the influence of ligand replacement on the photoconductivity of PbSe quantum-dot solids, using the time-resolved microwave conductivity technique. Bifunctional replacing ligands with amine, thiol, or carboxylic acid anchor groups of various lengths are used to assemble quantum solids via a layer-by-layer dip-coating method. We find that when the ligand lengths are the same, the charge carrier mobility is higher in quantum-dot solids with amine ligands, while in quantum-dot solids with thiol ligands the charge carrier lifetime is longer. If the anchor group is the same, the charge carrier mobility is ligand length dependent. The results show that the diffusion length of charge carriers can reach several hundred nanometers.},

The coupling to the non-Markovian environment is treated with a master equation derived from non-Markovian quantum state diffusion. When the excited-state dynamics is initialized at site eight, which is believed to play an important role in receiving excitation from the main light harvesting antenna, we see a slow exponential-like decay of the excitation. This is in contrast to the oscillations and a relatively fast transfer that usually occurs when initialization at sites 1 or 6 is considered. We show that different sets of electronic transition energies can lead to large differences in the transfer dynamics and may cause additional suppression or enhancement of oscillations.},

These values of DeltaE(g) are the largest shifts achieved by chemical modification of the surfaces of solution-phase CdSe QDs and are-by more than an order of magnitude in energy-the largest bathochromic shifts achieved for QDs in either the solution or solid phases. Measured values of DeltaE(g) upon coordination to PTC correspond to an apparent increase in the excitonic radius of 0.26 +/- 0.03 nm; this excitonic delocalization is independent of the size of the QD for radii, R = 1.1-1.9 nm. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the highest occupied molecular orbital of PTC is near resonant with that of the QD, and that the two have correct symmetry to exchange electron density (PTC is a pi-donor, and the photoexcited QD is a pi-acceptor). We therefore propose that the relaxation of exciton confinement occurs through delocalization of the photoexcited hole of the QD into the ligand shell.},

abstract = {Optical gain in strongly confined colloidal semiconductor quantum dots is measured using state resolved pump/probe spectroscopy. Though size tunable optical amplification has been previously reported for these materials, the influence of confinement enhanced multiexcitonic interactions has limited prior demonstrations to specific particle sizes or host media. Here we show that the influence of the interfering multiexcitonic interactions, and hence the development of optical gain, is dependent on the identity of the initially prescribed excitonic state. By maintaining a constant excitonic state in the size tunable electronic structure of these materials, we recover the predicted universal development of optical gain, reflected by size-independent occupation thresholds, and differential gains. In addition, we explicitly compare the influence of surface passivation on the development and lifetime of the optical gain. Furthermore, we introduce a general, state-resolved pumping scheme which enables control over the optical gain spectrum. The capacity to manipulate the optical gain spectra of these spherically confined systems is evident in both the measured stimulated emission and amplified spontaneous emission. We anticipate that state-resolved optical excitation will be a useful method of enabling the development and manipulation of optical gain in any quantized nanostructure.},

abstract = {The ability of the semiconductor industry to continue scaling microelectronic devices to ever smaller dimensions (a trend known as Moore's Law) is limited by quantum mechanical effects: as the thickness of conventional silicon dioxide (SiO2) gate insulators is reduced to just a few atomic layers, electrons can tunnel directly through the films. Continued device scaling will therefore probably require the replacement of the insulator with high-dielectric-constant (high-k) oxides, to increase its thickness, thus preventing tunnelling currents while retaining the electronic properties of an ultrathin SiO2 film. Ultimately, such insulators will require an atomically defined interface with silicon without an interfacial SiO2 layer for optimal performance. Following the first reports of epitaxial growth of AO and ABO3 compounds on silicon, the formation of an atomically abrupt crystalline interface between strontium titanate and silicon was demonstrated. However, the atomic structure proposed for this interface is questionable because it requires silicon atoms that have coordinations rarely found elsewhere in nature. Here we describe first-principles calculations of the formation of the interface between silicon and strontium titanate and its atomic structure. Our study shows that atomic control of the interfacial structure by altering the chemical environment can dramatically improve the electronic properties of the interface to meet technological requirements. The interface structure and its chemistry may provide guidance for the selection process of other high-k gate oxides and for controlling their growth.},

abstract = {In studying ultrafast electron transfer from a dye molecule to a nanosized semiconductor particle, pump-probe experiments are commonly used. In this system the electron transfer (ET) rate is faster than vibrational relaxation so that the ET rate should be described by a single-level rate constant and the probing signal (often in the form of time-resolved spectra) contains the contribution from the dynamics of both population and coherence (i.e., wave packet). In this paper, we shall present the theoretical treatments for femtosecond time-resolved pump-probe experiment and the dynamics of population and coherence by the density matrix method, and the calculation of single-level ET rate constant involved in a pump-probe experiment. As an application, we show the theoretical results using parameters extracted from experiments on a specific dye/semiconductor system.},

Computed translational diffusion coefficients displayed the non-Arrhenius behavior expected of a fragile glass-forming liquid and were in good, semiquantitative agreement with experimental results. Rotational correlation functions calculated for various vectors within the molecule exhibited a very short time (0-1 ps) initial decay, followed by a reversal, which corresponds to free reorientation within the "solvent" cage prior to collision with a wall. Rotational correlation times of three orthogonal vectors fixed on the central benzene were close to equal at all temperatures, indicating nearly isotropic overall molecular reorientation. The average correlation times exhibited a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence and were in very good agreement with experimental values derived from 2D and 1H NMR relaxation times. Correlation times of vectors located on the lateral phenyl rings were used to calculate the "spinning" internal rotation diffusion coefficients, which were approximately twice as great as the overall rotational diffusion constants, indicating rapid internal rotation of the phenyl side groups over wide ranges of angle in the liquid.},

abstract = {Photosynthetic light-harvesting antennae direct energy collected from sunlight to reaction centers with remarkable efficiency and rapidity. Despite their common function, the pigment-protein complexes that make up antenna systems in different types of photosynthetic organisms exhibit a wide variety of structural forms. Some individual organisms express different types of complexes depending on growth conditions. For example, purple photosynthetic bacteria Rp. palustris preferentially synthesize light-harvesting complex 4 (LH4), a structural variant of the more common and widely studied LH2, when grown under low-light conditions. Here, we investigate the ultrafast dynamics and energy level structure of LH4 using two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy in combination with theoretical simulations. The experimental data reveal dynamics on two distinct time scales, consistent with coherent dephasing within approximately the first 100 fs, followed by relaxation of population into lower-energy states on a picosecond time scale. We observe excited state absorption (ESA) features marking the existence of high-energy dark states, which suggest that the strongest dipole-dipole coupling in the complex occurs between bacteriochlorophyll transition dipole moments in an in-line geometry. The results help to refine the current understanding of the pigment organization in the LH4 complex, for which a high-resolution crystal structure is not yet available.},

abstract = {In this paper we explore the effects of medium dynamics on activationless and inverted-region electron transfer (ET), when medium-induced dynamics is slow on the time scale of the electronic processes. ET dynamics, with electron-nuclear coupling to the medium modes, was characterized in terms of incoherent population decay of vibronic states in the initial donor-acceptor manifold, which is characterized by nonadiabatic, energy (E)-dependent, microscopic ET rates, k(E). These k(E)'s are determined by average Franck-Condon densities (AFDs), which were evaluated by quantum and classical formalisms, with model calculations being performed for multimode harmonic systems with displaced potential surfaces. In spite of the intrinsic limitations of the classical AFDs, which do not account for mode specificity and nuclear tunneling effects, the classical Franck-Condon factors provide a good description of the E dependence of the microscopic ET rates. For activationless ET we show that k(E)∝(E+nϵ)−View the MathML source, where nϵ is the zero point energy, implying a weak energy dependence of k(E). Accordingly, the averaged experimental activationless ET rates exhibit a weak variation between the limits of slow medium-induced relaxation and that of fast medium-induced dynamics. Subsequently, the theory of k(E) was extended to include the effects of ET-induced excitations of high-frequency intramolecular vibrational modes, providing a unified description of the weak E dependence of k(E) in the activationless and inverted regions. We predict that for activationless and inverted-region ET the experimental ET rates are only weakly dependent on the characteristics of medium relaxation dynamics, and can be appreciably higher than the solvent-controlled values (i.e., the reciprocal values of the medium relaxation time induced by a constant charge distribution). Our analysis provides an adequate explanation for recent experimental observations of ultrafast (k=(1 ps)−1–(100 fs)−1) activationless and inverted-region ET, which apparently violate the predictions of solvent-controlled ET theory.},

The azide-bound D(2)O bleach/stimulated emission signal, which is spectrally much narrower than its linear absorption spectrum, shows that the experiment is selective to solvation shell water molecules for population times up to \~{}500 fs. The waters around the ion are present in an electrostatically better defined environment. Afterwards, \~{}1 ps, the sample thermalizes and selectivity is lost. On the other hand, the excited state absorption signal of the azide-bound D(2)O is much broader. The asymmetry in spectral width between bleach/stimulated emission versus excited absorption has been observed in very much the same way for isotope-diluted ice Ih, where it has been attributed to the anharmonicity of the OD potential.},

The ab initio TD-HF and CIS methods reproduce the experimentally determined Stokes shift and spectral profiles to a high level of agreement, while the TD-B3LYP method significantly underestimates the Stokes shift, by 45\%.

abstract = {In order to investigate the electron dynamics at the alizarin/I2-/TiO2 interface this study uses a novel state-of-the-art quantum-classical approach that combines time-dependent density functional theory with surface hopping in the Kohn-Sham basis. Representing the dye-sensitized semiconductor Gr\"{a}tzel cell with the I-/I3- mediator, the system addresses the problems of an organic/inorganic, molecule/bulk interface that are commonly encountered in molecular electronics, photovoltaics, and photoelectrochemistry. The processes studied include the relaxation of the injected electron inside the TiO2 conduction band (CB), the back electron transfer (ET) from TiO2 to alizarin, the ET from the surface to the electrolyte, and the regeneration of the neutral chromophore by ET from the electrolyte to alizarin. Developing a theoretical understanding of these processes is crucial for improving solar cell design and optimizing photovoltaic current and voltage. The simulations carried out for the entire system that contains many electronic states reproduce the experimental time scales and provide detailed insights into the ET dynamics. In particular, they demonstrate the differences between the optimized geometric and electronic structure of the system at 0 K and the experimentally relevant structure at ambient temperature. The relaxation of the injected electron inside the TiO2 CB, which affects the solar cell voltage, is shown to occur on a 100 fs time scale and occurs simultaneously with the electron delocalization into the semiconductor bulk. The transfer of the electron trapped at the surface to the ground state of alizarin proceeds on a 1 ps time scale and is facilitated by vibrational modes localized on alizarin. If the electrolyte mediator is capable of approaching the semiconductor surface, it can form a stable complex and short-circuit the cell by accepting the photoexcited electron on a subpicosecond time scale. The ET from TiO2 to both alizarin and the electrolyte diminishes the solar cell current. Finally, the simulations show that the electrolyte can efficiently regenerate the neutral chromophore. This is true even though the two species do not form a chemical bond and, therefore, the electronic coupling between them is weaker than in the TiO2-chromophore and TiO2-electrolyte donor-acceptor pairs. The chromophore-electrolyte coupling can occur both directly through space and indirectly through bonding to the semiconductor surface. The ET events involving the electrolyte are promoted primarily by the electrolyte vibrational modes.},

The detailed understanding of the tuning of site energies by the protein has been an unsolved problem since the first high-resolution crystal structure of a light-harvesting antenna appeared >30 years ago [Fenna RE, Matthews BW (1975) Nature 258:573-577]. Here, we present a combined quantum chemical/electrostatic approach to compute site energies that considers the whole protein in atomic detail and provides the missing link between crystallography and spectroscopy. The calculation of site energies of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson protein results in optical spectra that are in quantitative agreement with experiment and reveals an unexpectedly strong influence of the backbone of two alpha-helices. The electric field from the latter defines the direction of excitation energy flow in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson protein, whereas the effects of amino acid side chains, hitherto thought to be crucial, largely compensate each other. This result challenges the current view of how energy flow is regulated in pigment-protein complexes and demonstrates that attention has to be paid to the backbone architecture.},

@article{Hanwell2012,
abstract = {Background: The Avogadro project has developed an advancedmolecule editor and visualizer designed for cross-platform use in computational chemistry,molecular modeling, bioinformatics,materials science, and related areas. It offers flexible, high quality rendering, and a powerful plugin architecture. Typical uses include building molecular structures, formatting input files, and analyzing output of a wide variety of computational chemistry packages. By using the CML file format as its native document type, Avogadro seeks to enhance the semantic accessibility of chemical data types. Results: The work presented here details the Avogadro library, which is a framework providing a code library and application programming interface (API) with three-dimensional visualization capabilities; and has direct applications to research and education in the fields of chemistry, physics,materials science, and biology. The Avogadro application provides a rich graphical interface using dynamically loaded plugins through the library itself. The application and library can each be extended by implementing a pluginmodule in C++ or Python to explore different visualization techniques, build/manipulate molecular structures, and interact with other programs.We describe some example extensions, one which uses a genetic algorithm to find stable crystal structures, and one which interfaces with the PackMol program to create packed, solvated structures for molecular dynamics simulations. The 1.0 release series of Avogadro is the main focus of the results discussed here. Conclusions: Avogadro offers a semantic chemical builder and platform for visualization and analysis. For users, it offers an easy-to-use builder, integrated support for downloading from common databases such as PubChem and the Protein Data Bank, extracting chemical data from a wide variety of formats, including computational chemistry output, and native, semantic support for the CML file format. For developers, it can be easily extended via a powerful plugin mechanism to support new features in organic chemistry, inorganic complexes, drug design,materials, biomolecules, and simulations.

abstract = {Electron transmission through molecules and molecular interfaces has been a subject of intensive research due to recent interest in electron-transfer pheno- mena underlying the operation of the scanning-tunneling microscope on one hand, and in the transmission properties of molecular bridges between conducting leads on the other. In these processes, the traditional molecular view of electron transfer be- tween donor and acceptor species gives rise to a novel view of the molecule as a current-carrying conductor, and observables such as electron-transfer rates and yields are replaced by the conductivities, or more generally by current-voltage relationships, in molecular junctions. Such investigations of electrical junctions, in which single molecules or small molecular assemblies operate as conductors, constitute a major part of the active field of molecular electronics. In this article I review the current knowledge and understanding of this field, with particular emphasis on theoretical is- sues. Different approaches to computing the conduction properties of molecules and molecular assemblies are reviewed, and the relationships between them are discussed. Following a detailed discussion of static-junctions models, a review of our current un- derstanding of the role played by inelastic processes, dephasing and thermal-relaxation effects is provided. The most important molecular environment for electron transfer and transmission is water, and our current theoretical understanding of electron trans- mission through water layers is reviewed. Finally, a brief discussion of overbarrier transmission, exemplified by photoemission through adsorbed molecular layers or low-energy electron transmission through such layers, is provided. Similarities and differences between the different systems studied are discussed.},

abstract = {We analyzed critical life-history variables for two rare fire-dependent annual Geranium species in southern Swe- den, which are today threatened because of effective fire suppression. At recently burned sites with abundant recruitment, seedlings occurred only where the humus layer had been completely removed by smoldering fire. Emergence depths ranged 1–6 cm in the mineral soil. Soil sampling at four sites revealed that in unburned soil Geranium seeds were located only in the mineral soil. Surprisingly, residual seeds were still present where fire had burned away the humus layer. An experiment showed that both species deposit seeds relatively evenly within a radius of 5–6 m, through ballistic dispersal. Repeated sam- pling in the field over a 2-year period after seed dispersal at one site indicated a low rate of seed depletion, corroborated by an indoor incubation of seeds. Our results show that successful management of these species depend on deep-burning pre- scribed fire, which can only result after severe drought. On the other hand, the seed bank is extremely long-lived, as viable seeds were present at a site last burned 200 years ago. This well-protected seed bank will likely buffer against both ill-timed fires and occasional failure in the recruiting seedling populations. Key},

abstract = {We provide physically intuitive mechanisms for the effect of noise on excitation energy transfer (EET) in networks. Using these mechanisms of dephasing-assisted transport (DAT) in a hybrid basis of both excitons and sites, we develop a detailed picture of how noise enables energy transfer with efficiencies well above 90\% across the Fenna–Matthew–Olson (FMO) complex, a type of light-harvesting molecule. We demonstrate explicitly how noise alters the pathways of energy transfer across the complex, suppressing ineffective pathways and facilitating direct ones to the reaction centre. We explain that the fundamental mechanisms underpinning DAT are expected to be robust with respect to the considered noise model but show that the specific details of the exciton–phonon coupling, which remain largely unknown in these type of complexes, and in particular the impact of non-Markovian effects, result in variations of dynamical features that should be amenable to experimental verification with current or planned technology. A detailed understanding of DAT in natural compounds could open up a new paradigm of 'noise-engineering' by which EET can be optimized in artificial light-harvesting structures.},

A simulation is performed showing the utility of optimally setting the individual voltages applied to a multi-pixel surface gate array in order to produce a spatially inhomogeneous potential within the subsurface scattering plane. The coherent constructive and destructive electron wave interferences are manipulated by optimally adjusting the potential shapes to alter the scattering patterns. In scenario II, molecular vibrational wave packets are controlled by means of optimally selecting the Hamiltonian structure in cooperation with an applied field. As an illustration of the concept, a collection (i.e., a level set) of dipole functions is identified where each member serves with the same applied electric field to produce the desired final transition probability. The level set algorithm additionally found Hamiltonian structure controls exhibiting desirable physical properties. The prospects of utilizing the applied field and Hamiltonian structure simultaneously as controls is also explored. The control scenarios I and II indicate the gains offered by algorithmically guided molecular or material discovery for manipulating quantum dynamics phenomenon.},

We find an Auger coefficient of 4.5 x 10(-30) cm6/s for dots of 5.5 nm diameter, and observe saturation of the absorption bleaching when the (8-fold degenerate) first level is filled. We develop a model for the absorption dynamics using Poisson statistics and find a good fit with our experimental measurements.},

@article{Klimov2006,
abstract = {One consequence of strong spatial confinement of electronic wave functions in ultrasmall semiconductor nanocrystals is a great enhancement of carrier-carrier interactions, which has a dramatic effect on the spectral and dynamical properties of both single and multiexciton states. Strong carrier-carrier interactions open new nanocrystal-specific energy relaxation and recombination channels associated, e.g., with electron-hole energy transfer and ultrafast nonradiative Auger recombination. Further, they lead to extremely efficient direct photogeneration of multiple electron-hole pairs (excitons) by single photons known as carrier (or exciton) multiplication. This review focuses on the effect of Coulomb interactions on carrier recombination and photogeneration mechanisms in nanocrystals based on II-VI (e.g., CdSe) and IV-VI (e.g., PbSe) compounds. The specific topics discussed here include the fine structure of the band-edge optical transitions and its effect on temperature-dependent single-exciton recombination dynamics, Auger recombination of multiexcitons in size- and shape-controlled nanocrystals with a specific emphasis on optical-gain properties of nanocrystalline materials (including quantum rods and multicomponent core-shell heterostructures), and the direct generation of multiple excitons via carrier multiplication and its implications in photovoltaic technologies.},

abstract = {A thorough energy benchmark study of various density functionals (DFs) is carried out with the new GMTKN30 database for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics and noncovalent interactions [Goerigk and Grimme, J. Chem. Theor. Comput., 2010, 6, 107; Goerigk and Grimme, J. Chem. Theor. Comput., 2011, 7, 291]. In total, 47 DFs are investigated: two LDAs, 14 GGAs, three meta-GGAs, 23 hybrids and five double-hybrids. Besides the double-hybrids, also other modern approaches, i.e., the M05 and M06 classes of functionals and range-separated hybrids, are tested. For almost all functionals, the new DFT-D3 correction is applied in order to consistently test the performance also for important noncovalent interactions; the parameters are taken from previous works or determined for the present study. Basis set and quadrature grid issues are also considered. The general aim of the study is to work out which functionals are generally well applicable and robust to describe the energies of molecules. In summary, we recommend on the GGA level the B97-D3 and revPBE-D3 functionals. The best meta-GGA is oTPSS-D3 although meta-GGAs represent in general no clear improvement compared to numerically simpler GGAs. Notably, the widely used B3LYP functional performs worse than the average of all tested hybrids and is also very sensitive to the application of dispersion corrections. We discourage its usage as a standard method without closer inspection of the results, as it still seems to be often done nowadays. Surprisingly, long-range corrected exchange functionals do in general not perform better than the corresponding standard hybrids. However, the $\omega$B97X-D functional seems to be a promising method. The most robust hybrid is Zhao and Truhlar's PW6B95 functional in combination with DFT-D3. If higher accuracy is required, double-hybrids should be applied. The corresponding DSD-BLYP-D3 and PWPB95-D3 variants are the most accurate and robust functionals of the entire study. Additional calculations with MP2 and and its spin-scaled variants SCS-MP2, S2-MP2 and SOS-MP2 revealed that double-hybrids in general outperform those. Only SCS-MP2 can be recommended, particularly for reaction energies. We suggest its usage when a large self-interaction error is expected that prohibits usage of double-hybrids. Perdews' metaphoric picture of Jacob's Ladder for the classification of density functionals' performance could unbiasedly be confirmed with GMTKN30. We also show that there is no statistical correlation between a functional's accuracy for atomization energies and the performance for chemically more relevant reaction energies.},

In this work the rate of electron exchange is calculated by a combination of quantum mechanics and computer simulations. This method is valid for all strengths of the electronic interaction, so that the dependence of the reaction rate on the interaction strength could be obtained. Our results encompass three different regimes; in the order of increasing interaction these are: (i) a linear region, in which first-order perturbation theory holds; (ii) a weakly adiabatic region, in which the rate is limited by solvent dynamics; (iii) a strongly adiabatic region, in which the interaction lowers the energy of activation.},

The femtosecond decay of S(2) to the S(1) excited state and the picosecond decay of S(2) to the ground electronic state S(0) are studied within an efficient methodology for computing the intramolecular dynamics in multidimensional configurational spaces. Our method is based on partitioning the full configuration space into the (small) subspace of interest Q and the rest, the subspace P. The exact equations of motion for the states in Q, under the influence of P, are derived in the time domain in form of a system of integrodifferential equations. Their numerical solution is readily obtained when the Q space consists of just a few states. Otherwise, the integrodifferential equations for the states in Q are transformed into a (larger) system of ordinary differential equations, which can be solved by a single diagonalization of a general complex matrix. The former approach is applied to study the pyrazine picosecond S(2)→S(0) dynamics and the latter is applied to the study of the ultrafast pyrazine S(2)→S(1) decay dynamics.},

abstract = {Efficient self-consistent field (SCF) schemes including both scalar relativistic effects and spin-orbit (SO) interactions at Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional (DFT) levels are presented. SO interactions require the extension of standard procedures to two-component formalisms. Efficiency is achieved by using effective core potentials (ECPs) and by employing the resolution-of-the-identity approximation for the Coulomb part (RI-J) in pure DFT calculations as well as also for the HF-exchange part (RI-JK) in the case of HF or hybrid-DFT treatments. The procedures were implemented in the program system TURBOMOLE; efficiency is demonstrated for comparably large systems, such as Pb54. Relevance of SO effects for electronic structure and stability is illustrated by treatments of small Pb and Po clusters with and without accounting for SO effects.},

abstract = {Long-lived quantum coherence has been experimentally observed in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) light-harvesting complex. It is much debated which role thermal effects play and if the observed low-temperature behavior arises also at physiological temperature. To contribute to this debate we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the coupling between the protein environment and the vertical excitation energies of individual bacteriochlorophyll molecules in the FMO complex of the green sulphur bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum. The so-called spectral densities, which account for the environmental influence on the excited state dynamics, are determined from temporal autocorrelation functions of the energy gaps between ground and first excited states of the individual pigments. Although the overall shape of the spectral density is found to be rather similar for all pigments, variations in their magnitude can be seen. Differences between the spectral densities for the pigments of the FMO monomer and FMO trimer are also presented.},

abstract = {We have investigated in detail the effect of CdS and ZnS as second phases on the thermoelectric properties of p-type PbS. We report a ZT of ∼1.3 at 923 K for 2.5 at.\% Na-doped p-type PbS with endotaxially nanostructured 3.0 at.\% CdS. We attribute the high ZT to the combination of broad-based phonon scattering on multiple length scales to reduce (lattice) thermal conductivity and favorable charge transport through coherent interfaces between the PbS matrix and metal sulfide nanophase precipitates, which maintains the requisite high carrier conductivity and the associated power factor. Similar to large ionically bonded metal sulfides (ZnS, CaS, and SrS), the covalently bonded CdS can also effectively reduce the lattice thermal conductivity in p-type PbS. The presence of ubiquitous nanostructuring was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Valence and conduction band energy levels of the NaCl-type metal sulfides, MS (M = Pb, Cd, Zn, Ca, and Sr) were calculated from density functional theory to gain insight into the band alignment between PbS and the second phases in these materials. The hole transport is controlled by band offset minimization through the alignment of valence bands between the host PbS and the embedded second phases, MS (M = Cd, Zn, Ca, and Sr). The smallest valence band offset of about 0.13 eV at 0 K was found between PbS and CdS which is diminished further by thermal band broadening at elevated temperature. This allows carrier transport between the endotaxially aligned components (i.e., matrix and nanostructure), thus minimizing significant deterioration of the hole mobility and power factor. We conclude the thermoelectric performance of the PbS system and, by extension, other systems can be enhanced by means of a closely coupled phonon-blocking/electron-transmitting approach through embedding endotaxially nanostructured second phases.},

abstract = {A traditional quantum optimal control experiment begins with a specific physical system and seeks an optimal time-dependent field to steer the evolution towards a target observable value. In a more general framework, the Hamiltonian structure may also be manipulated when the material or molecular 'stockroom' is accessible as a part of the controls. The current work takes a step in this direction by considering the converse of the normal perspective to now start with a specific fixed field and employ the system's time-independent Hamiltonian structure as the control to identify an optimal form. The Hamiltonian structure control variables are taken as the system energies and transition dipole matrix elements. An analysis is presented of the Hamiltonian structure control landscape, defined by the observable as a function of the Hamiltonian structure. A proof of system controllability is provided, showing the existence of a Hamiltonian structure that yields an arbitrary unitary transformation when working with virtually any field. The landscape analysis shows that there are no suboptimal traps (i.e., local extrema) for controllable quantum systems when unconstrained structural controls are utilized to optimize a state-to-state transition probability. This analysis is corroborated by numerical simulations on model multilevel systems. The search effort to reach the top of the Hamiltonian structure landscape is found to be nearly invariant to system dimension. A control mechanism analysis is performed, showing a wide variety of behavior for different systems at the top of the Hamiltonian structure landscape. It is also shown that reducing the number of available Hamiltonian structure controls, thus constraining the system, does not always prevent reaching the landscape top. The results from this work lay a foundation for considering the laboratory implementation of optimal Hamiltonian structure manipulation for seeking the best control performance, especially with limited electromagnetic resources.},

abstract = {The energy transfer (ET) between InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well (MQW) nanorods (NRs) and semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) for effi cient color con- version is studied. An exceptional contribution of carrier transport confi nement to the ET mechanisms is observed in the proximal side-wall coupling system, which consists of InGaN/GaN NRs and CdSe NCs. Under relatively low or high excitation, the ET rate shows different carrier-density dependence, resulting from different electron-hole confi gurations, i.e., bound excitons and free car- riers. In the localized exciton regime, the ET rate decreases when increasing temperature from 20 K to 200 K. However, in the free-carrier regime, the ET rate varies insignifi cantly in the same temperature range. The temperature dependence in this NR-NC coupling system is different from that in the previ- ously studied planar MQW-NC coupling system. It is suggested that the carrier transport confi nement in NRs is a major factor for these divergences. The highly effi cient ET with effi ciency up to 80\% shows a promising potential of using such NR-NC coupled structures for ET-pumped, NC-based, light-emitting devices.},

abstract = {Purple membrane (PM) from bacteria Halobacterium salinarum contains a photochromic protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR) arranged in a 2D hexagonal nanocrystalline lattice (Figure 1 ). Absorption of light by the protein-bound chromophore retinal results in pumping the protons through the PM creating an electrochemical gradient which is then used by the ATPases to energize the cellular processes. Energy conversion, photochromism, and photoelectrism are the inherent effects which are employed in many bR technical applications. bR, along with the other photosensitive proteins, is not able to deal with the excess energy of photons in UV and blue spectral region and utilizes less than 0.5\% of the energy from the available incident solar light for its biological function. Here, we proceed with optimization of bR functions through the engineering of a "nanoconverter" of solar energy based on semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) tagged with the PM. These nanoconverters are able to harvest light from deep-UV to the visible region and to transfer this additionally collected energy to bR via F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). We show that specific nanobio-optical and spatial coupling of QDs (donor) and bR retinal (acceptor) provide a means to achieve FRET with efficiency approaching 100\%. We have finally demonstrated that the integration of QDs within PM significantly increases the efficiency of light-driven transmembrane proton pumping, which is the main bR biological function. This new QD-PM hybrid material will have numerous optoelectronic, photonic, and photovoltaic applications based on its energy conversion, photochromism, and photoelectrism properties.},

The experimental data show a power-law relationship between conductances and charge transfer rates within a given class of molecules with the same bridge chemistry, and a lack of correlation when a more diverse group of molecules is compared, in contrast with some theoretical predictions. Surprisingly, the PNA duplexes exhibit the lowest charge-transfer rates and the highest molecular conductances. The nonlinear rate?conductance relationships for structures with the same bridging chemistries are attributed to differences in the charge-mediation characteristics of the molecular bridge, energy barrier shifts and electronic dephasing, in the two different experimental settings.},

abstract = {Semiconductor Quantum Dots (QDs) currently receive widespread attention for the development of photovoltaic devices due to the possibility of tailoring their optoelectronic properties by the control of size and composition. Here we show that it is possible to design both injection and recombination in QD sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) by the appropriate use of molecular dipoles and conformal coatings. QDSCs have been manufactured using mesoporous TiO(2) electrodes coated with "in situ" grown CdSe semiconductor nanocrystals by chemical bath deposition (CBD). Surface modification of the CdSe sensitized electrodes by conformal ZnS coating and grafting of molecular dipoles (DT) has been explored to both increase the injection from QDs into the TiO(2) matrix and reduce the recombination of the QD sensitized electrodes. Different sequences of both treatments have been tested aiming at boosting the energy conversion efficiency of the devices. The obtained results showed that the most favorable sequence of the surface treatment (DT+ZnS) led to a dramatic 600\% increase of photovoltaic performance compared to the reference electrode (without modification): V(oc) = 0.488 V, j(sc) = 9.74 mA/cm(2), FF = 0.34, and efficiency = 1.60\% under full 1 sun illumination. The measured photovoltaic performance was correlated to the relative position of the CdSe conduction band (characterized by surface photovoltage measurements) and TiO(2) conduction band (characterized by the chemical capacitance, C(mu)) together with recombination resistance, R(rec).},

At the focus of the present study are the light-harvesting II complexes of the purple bacterium Rhodospirillum molischianum. The calculations are based on a time-dependent combination of molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry methods. Using a 12 ps long trajectory, different quantum chemical methods have been compared to each other. Furthermore, several approaches to determine the couplings between the individual chromophores have been tested. Correlations between energy gap fluctuations of different individual pigments are analyzed but found to be negligible. From the energy gap fluctuations, spectral densities are extracted which serve as input for calculations of optical properties and exciton dynamics. To this end, the spectral densities are tested by determining the linear absorption of the complete two-ring system. One important difference from earlier studies is given by the severely extended length of the trajectory along which the quantum chemical calculations have been performed. Due to this extension, more accurate and reliable data have been obtained in the low frequency regime which is important in the dynamics of electronic relaxation.},

abstract = {In traditional photoconductors, the impinging light generates mobile charge carriers in the valence and/or conduction bands, causing the material's conductivity to increase. Such positive photoconductance is observed in both bulk and nanostructured photoconductors. Here we describe a class of nanoparticle-based materials whose conductivity can either increase or decrease on irradiation with visible light of wavelengths close to the particles' surface plasmon resonance. The remarkable feature of these plasmonic materials is that the sign of the conductivity change and the nature of the electron transport between the nanoparticles depend on the molecules comprising the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) stabilizing the nanoparticles. For SAMs made of electrically neutral (polar and non-polar) molecules, conductivity increases on irradiation. If, however, the SAMs contain electrically charged (either negatively or positively) groups, conductivity decreases. The optical and electrical characteristics of these previously undescribed inverse photoconductors can be engineered flexibly by adjusting the material properties of the nanoparticles and of the coating SAMs. In particular, in films comprising mixtures of different nanoparticles or nanoparticles coated with mixed SAMs, the overall photoconductance is a weighted average of the changes induced by the individual components. These and other observations can be rationalized in terms of light-induced creation of mobile charge carriers whose transport through the charged SAMs is inhibited by carrier trapping in transient polaron-like states. The nanoparticle-based photoconductors we describe could have uses in chemical sensors and/or in conjunction with flexible substrates.},

abstract = {Although photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes are in noisy environments, recent experimental and theoretical results indicate that their excitation energy transfer (EET) can exhibit coherent characteristics for over hundreds of femtoseconds. Despite the almost universal observations of the coherence to some degree, questions still remain regarding the detailed role of the protein and the extent of high-temperature coherence. Here we adopt a theoretical method that incorporates an all-atom description of the photosynthetic complex within a semiclassical framework in order to study EET in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. We observe that the vibrational modes of the chromophore tend to diminish the coherence at the ensemble level, yet much longer-lived coherences may be observed at the single-complex level. We also observe that coherent oscillations in the site populations also commence within tens of femtoseconds even when the system is initially prepared in a non-oscillatory stationary state. We show that the protein acts to maintain the electronic couplings among the system of embedded chromophores. We also investigate the extent to which the protein's electrostatic modulation that disperses the chromophore electronic energies may affect the coherence lifetime. Further, we observe that even though mutation-induced disruptions in the protein structure may change the coupling pattern, a relatively strong level of coupling and associated coherence in the dynamics still remain. Finally, we demonstrate that thermal fluctuations in the chromophore couplings induce some redundancy in the coherent energy-transfer pathway. Our results indicate that a description of both chromophore coupling strengths and their fluctuations is crucial to better understand coherent EET processes in photosynthetic systems.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the processes of exciton transfer in coupled nanoparticles and nanowires, and obtain convenient equations and numerical results for energy-transfer rates. For large distances, the energy-transfer rates are proportional to 1/d(5), where d is the nanoparticle-nanowire distance. Our models incorporate both semiconductor and metal material systems. In this paper, we show that excitonic energy generated optically in nanoparticles can be efficiently extracted and channeled to nanowires/nanotubes by utilizing the Forster energy-transfer mechanism. In particular, we propose a complex composed of an indirect-band semiconductor nanowire (silicon) and direct-band nanoparticles (CdTe). The efficiency of light harvesting in the CdTe-Si complex becomes strongly enhanced due to a strongly increased absorption cross section and a reduced absorption anisotropy. The system has potential for optoelectronic applications. Hybrid metal-semiconductor complexes have more efficient energy transfer and may be used for sensors. This paper describes available experimental data and suggests further experimental realizations.},

abstract = {Electronic coherence dynamics in trans-polyacetylene oligomers are considered by explicitly computing the time dependent molecular polarization from the coupled dynamics of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom in a mean-field mixed quantum-classical approximation. The oligomers are described by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian and the effect of decoherence is incorporated by propagating an ensemble of quantum-classical trajectories with initial conditions obtained by sampling the Wigner distribution of the nuclear degrees of freedom. The electronic coherence of superpositions between the ground and excited and between pairs of excited states is examined for chains of different length, and the dynamics is discussed in terms of the nuclear overlap function that appears in the off-diagonal elements of the electronic reduced density matrix. For long oligomers the loss of coherence occurs in tens of femtoseconds. This time scale is determined by the decay of population into other electronic states through vibronic interactions, and is relatively insensitive to the type and class of superposition considered. By contrast, for smaller oligomers the decoherence time scale depends strongly on the initially selected superposition, with superpositions that can decay as fast as 50 fs and as slow as 250 fs. The long-lived superpositions are such that little population is transferred to other electronic states and for which the vibronic dynamics is relatively harmonic.},

Femtosecond laser-induced dynamical quantum processes on solid surfaces (DQPSS) lead to efficient desorption, dissociation, and reaction of adsorbed molecules. Control of the chemical pathways is achieved by varying the duration and fluence of the laser pulses, thus accessing different excitation and energy transfer mechanisms. By adjusting the time delay between two laser pulses, the timescales of DQPSS can be directly probed. The DQPSS driven by femtosecond lasers are also involved in the spatially resolved chemistry and materials modification induced by the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope. Insights into the microscopic mechanisms in conventional thermal desorption and chemistry are also gained from studies of femtosecond laser-induced DQPSS. A general understanding of these different surface phenomena is emerging.},

abstract = {Photosynthetic complexes are exquisitely tuned to capture solar light efficiently, and then transmit the excitation energy to reaction centres, where long term energy storage is initiated. The energy transfer mechanism is often described by semiclassical models that invoke 'hopping' of excited-state populations along discrete energy levels. Two-dimensional Fourier transform electronic spectroscopy has mapped these energy levels and their coupling in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) bacteriochlorophyll complex, which is found in green sulphur bacteria and acts as an energy 'wire' connecting a large peripheral light-harvesting antenna, the chlorosome, to the reaction centre. The spectroscopic data clearly document the dependence of the dominant energy transport pathways on the spatial properties of the excited-state wavefunctions of the whole bacteriochlorophyll complex. But the intricate dynamics of quantum coherence, which has no classical analogue, was largely neglected in the analyses-even though electronic energy transfer involving oscillatory populations of donors and acceptors was first discussed more than 70 years ago, and electronic quantum beats arising from quantum coherence in photosynthetic complexes have been predicted and indirectly observed. Here we extend previous two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy investigations of the FMO bacteriochlorophyll complex, and obtain direct evidence for remarkably long-lived electronic quantum coherence playing an important part in energy transfer processes within this system. The quantum coherence manifests itself in characteristic, directly observable quantum beating signals among the excitons within the Chlorobium tepidum FMO complex at 77 K. This wavelike characteristic of the energy transfer within the photosynthetic complex can explain its extreme efficiency, in that it allows the complexes to sample vast areas of phase space to find the most efficient path.},

@article{Kim2009,
abstract = {The theory of electronic structure of many-electron systems, such as molecules, is extraordinarily complicated. A consideration of how electron density is distributed on average in the average field of the other electrons in the system, that is, mean field theory, is very instructive. However, quantitatively describing chemical bonds, reactions, and spectroscopy requires consideration of the way that electrons avoid each other while moving; this is called electron correlation (or in physics, the many-body problem for fermions). Although great progress has been made in theory, there is a need for incisive experimental tests for large molecular systems in the condensed phase. In this Account, we report a two-dimensional (2D) optical coherent spectroscopy that correlates the double-excited electronic states to constituent single-excited states. The technique, termed 2D double-quantum coherence spectroscopy (2D-DQCS), uses multiple, time-ordered ultrashort coherent optical pulses to create double- and single-quantum coherences over time intervals between the pulses. The resulting 2D electronic spectrum is a map of the energy correlation between the first excited state and two-photon allowed double-quantum states. The underlying principle of the experiment is that when the energy of the double-quantum state, viewed in simple models as a double HOMO-to-LUMO (highest occupied to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) excitation, equals twice that of a single excitation, then no signal is radiated. However, electron-electron interactions, a combination of exchange interactions and electron correlation, in real systems generates a signal that reveals precisely how the energy of the double-quantum resonance differs from twice the single-quantum resonance. The energy shift measured in this experiment reveals how the second excitation is perturbed by both the presence of the first excitation and the way that the other electrons in the system have responded to the presence of that first excitation. We compare a series of organic dye molecules and find that the energy offset for adding a second electronic excitation to the system relative to the first excitation is on the order of tens of millielectronvolts; it also depends quite sensitively on molecular geometry. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of 2D-DQCS for elucidating quantitative information about electron-electron interactions, many-electron wave functions, and electron correlation in electronic excited states and excitons. Our work helps illuminate the implications of electron correlation on chemical systems. In a broad sense, we are trying to help address the fundamental question "How do we go beyond the orbital representation of electrons in the chemical sciences?"},

abstract = {To analyse the potential reaction to firegenerated heat pulses, seeds of 12 species of plants and rhizomes of three species were exposed to elevated temperatures for 10 min. The tested material split into three groups with respect to heat tolerance: (1) the rhizomes, for which the lethal temperatures were in the range 55–59° C; (2) the seeds of most of the species tested, for which the lethal temperatures were in the range 65–75° C; (3) The seeds of two species of Leguminosae and three species of Geranium for which the lethal temperatures were around 100° C. For all three Geranium species and for one of the legume species, Anthyllis vulneraria, exposure temperatures above ca. 45° C resulted in dormancy release, and maximum germination occurred above 60–65° C. Speed of germination was little affected for most species, except after exposure to nearlethal temperatures, where it slowed down dramatically, although the seedlings emerging were healthy. We conclude that due to sharp temperature gradients in the soil during fire, differences in heat tolerance between species in most cases are not large enough to be a decisive factor in their post-fire colonising success. There are exceptions: the seeds of certain taxa that are impermeable to water in the dormant state, some of which have heat triggered germination.},

The molar ratio of R-An to QD ([R-An]:[QD]) at which the PL decreases by 50\% shifts by 4 orders of magnitude over the series R-An. The model employed to describe the data combines a Freundlich binding isotherm (which reflects the dependence of the binding affinity of the amine headgroups of R-An on the substituent R) with a function that describes the response of the PL to R-An ligands once they are bound at their equilibrium surface coverage. The latter function includes as a parameter the rate constant, k(nr), for nonradiative decay of the exciton at a site to which an R-An ligand is coordinated. The value of this parameter reveals that the predominant mechanism of QD-ligand interaction is passivation of Cd(2+) surface sites through sigma-donation for R-An ligands with R = H, Br, OCF(3), and reductive quenching through photoinduced hole transfer for R = MeO, (Me)(2)N.},

abstract = {Since it was first suggested that a single molecule might function as an active electronic component, a number of techniques have been developed to measure the charge transport properties of single molecules. Although scanning tunnelling microscopy observations under high vacuum conditions can allow stable measurements of electron transport, most measurements of a single molecule bonded in a metal-molecule-metal junction exhibit relatively large variations in conductance. As a result, even simple predictions about how molecules behave in such junctions have still not been rigorously tested. For instance, it is well known that the tunnelling current passing through a molecule depends on its conformation; but although some experiments have verified this effect, a comprehensive mapping of how junction conductance changes with molecular conformation is not yet available. In the simple case of a biphenyl--a molecule with two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond--conductance is expected to change with the relative twist angle between the two rings, with the planar conformation having the highest conductance. Here we use amine link groups to form single-molecule junctions with more reproducible current-voltage characteristics. This allows us to extract average conductance values from thousands of individual measurements on a series of seven biphenyl molecules with different ring substitutions that alter the twist angle of the molecules. We find that the conductance for the series decreases with increasing twist angle, consistent with a cosine-squared relation predicted for transport through pi-conjugated biphenyl systems.},

abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) provides a formally exact framework for quantum embedding. The appearance of nonadditive kinetic energy contributions in this context poses significant challenges, but using optimized effective potential (OEP) methods, various groups have devised DFT-in-DFT methods that are equivalent to Kohn-Sham (KS) theory on the whole system. This being the case, we note that a very considerable simplification arises from doing KS theory instead. We then describe embedding schemes that enforce Pauli exclusion via a projection technique, completely avoiding numerically demanding OEP calculations. Illustrative applications are presented using DFT-in-DFT, wave-function-in-DFT, and wave-function-in-Hartree-Fock embedding, and using an embedded many-body expansion.},

The optically dark nature of their active sites usually prevents a complete mapping of the photoinduced dynamics. In this work, transient X-ray absorption spectroscopy highlights the electronic and geometric changes that affect such a center in a bimetallic model complex. Upon selective excitation of the ruthenium chromophore, the cobalt moiety is reduced through intramolecular electron transfer and undergoes a spin flip accompanied by an average bond elongation of 0.20 ± 0.03 \AA. The analysis is supported by simulations based on density functional theory structures (B3LYP*/TZVP) and FEFF 9.0 multiple scattering calculations.

Concise and physically transparent, closed form expressions for the observables in a desorption experiment are given in terms of matrix elements of the interaction in stationary bases. The method is nonperturbative and spans the limits of weak to strong substrate–adsorbate interactions. We propose the possibility of relaxing several approximations frequently adopted in theoretical studies of desorption induced by electronic transitions. In particular, continuous decay of the transient electronic excitation produced by hot substrate carriers and the possibility of multiple electronic transitions follow naturally from the formulation and need not be introduced ad hoc. The description of time-delayed desorption, resulting from occurrence of predesorption resonances, entails neither conceptual nor computational difficulty and vibrational relaxation is consistently accounted for. The method is tested by application to an empirical model of the NH3/Cu photodesorption dynamics.},

For a compound to belong to a polar space group, dipole moments of individual species must be partially aligned. Incorporation of d0 early transition metal polyhedral BBUs into structures is a common method to create polar structures, owing to the second-order Jahn–Teller distortion these polyhedra contain. Less attention has been spent examining how to align the polar moments of BBUs. To address alignment, we present a study on previously reported bimetallic BBUs and synthesized compounds K10(M2OnF11–n)3X. These materials differ in their (non)centrosymmetry despite chemical and structural similarities. The vanadium compounds are centrosymmetric (space groups P3̅m1 or C2/m) while the niobium and molybdenum heterotypes are noncentrosymmetric (Pmn21). The difference in symmetry occurs owing to the presence of linear, bimetallic BBUs or $\Lambda$-shaped bimetallic BBUs and related packing effects. These $\Lambda$-shaped BBUs form as a consequence of the coordination environment around the bridging anion of the metal oxide fluoride BBUs.},

@article{Tremblay2013,
abstract = {A model for treating excitation and relaxation of adsorbates at metallic surfaces induced by non- adiabatic coupling is developed. The derivation is based on the concept of resonant electron transfer, where the adsorbate serves as a molecular bridge for the inelastic transition between an electron source and a sink. In this picture, energy relaxation and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at metallic surfaces are treated on an equal footing as a quasi-thermal process. The model goes beyond the local harmonic approximation and allows for an unbiased description of floppy systems with multiple potential wells. Further, the limitation of the product ansatz for the vibronic wave function to include the position-dependence of the non-adiabatic couplings is avoided by explicitly enforcing detailed balance. The theory is applied to the excitation of hydrogen on palladium, which has multi- ple local potential minima connected by low energy barriers. The main aspects investigated are the lifetimes of adsorbate vibrations in different adsorption sites, as well as the dependence of the excitation, response, and transfer rates on an applied potential bias. The excitation and relax- ation simulations reveal intricate population dynamics that depart significantly from the simplis- tic tunneling model in a truncated harmonic potential. In particular, the population decay from an initially occupied local minimum induced by the contact with an STM tip is found to be better described by a double exponential. The two rates are interpreted as a response to the system per- turbation and a transfer rate following the perturbation. The transfer rate is found to obey a power law, as was the case in previous experimental and theoretical work.},

We establish electronic energy alignment as a function of quantum dot size and surface chemistry. We find that replacing insulating oleic-acid cappingmolecules on the QDs by the short hydrazine or ethanedithiol molecules results in pinning of the valence bandmaximum(VBM) of QDs to ZnO substrate states, independent of QD size. This is in contrast to similar measurements on TiO2(110) where the alignment of the PbSe QD VBM to that of the TiO2 substrate depends onQDsize.We interpret these findings as indicative of strong electronic coupling ofQDswith the ZnOsurface but lesswith the TiO2 surface. Based on themeasured energy alignment,wepredict that electron injection fromthe 1se level in photo-excited PbSe QDs to ZnO can occurwith small QDs (diameter ϕ=3.4 nm), but energetically unfavorably for larger dots (ϕ=6.7 nm). In the latter, hot electrons above the 1se level are necessary for interfacial electron injection. ©},

abstract = {An accurate and numerically efficient method for the calculation of intermolecular Coulomb couplings between charge densities of electronic states and between transition densities of electronic excitations is presented. The coupling of transition densities yields the F\"{o}rster type excitation energy transfer coupling, and from the charge density coupling, a shift in molecular excitation energies results. Starting from an ab initio calculation of the charge and transition densities, atomic partial charges are determined such as to fit the resulting electrostatic potentials of the different states and the transition. The different intermolecular couplings are then obtained from the Coulomb couplings between the respective atomic partial charges. The excitation energy transfer couplings obtained in the present TrEsp (transition charge from electrostatic potential) method are compared with couplings obtained from the simple point-dipole and extended dipole approximations and with those from the ab initio transition density cube method of Kr\"{u}ger, Scholes, and Fleming. The present method is of the same accuracy as the latter but computationally more efficient. The method is applied to study strongly coupled pigments in the light-harvesting complexes of green sulfur bacteria (FMO), purple bacteria (LH2), and higher plants (LHC-II) and the "special pairs" of bacterial reaction centers and reaction centers of photosystems I and II. For the pigment dimers in the antennae, it is found that the mutual orientation of the pigments is optimized for maximum excitonic coupling. A driving force for this orientation is the Coulomb coupling between ground-state charge densities. In the case of excitonic couplings in the "special pairs", a breakdown of the point-dipole approximation is found for all three reaction centers, but the extended dipole approximation works surprisingly well, if the extent of the transition dipole is chosen larger than assumed previously. For the "special pairs", a large shift in local transition energies is found due to charge density coupling.},

abstract = {Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy is used to study charge transfer dynamics in hybrid films composed of the low band gap polymer PCPDTBT and CdSe quantum dots capped with tert-butylthiol ligands. By selectively exciting the polymer, a spectral signature for electrons on the quantum dots appears on ultrafast time scales (≲ 65 fs), which indicates ultrafast electron transfer. From this time scale, the coupling between the polymer chains and the quantum dots is estimated to be J ≳ 17 meV. The reduced quantum dot acceptors exhibit an unambiguous spectral bleach signature, whose amplitude allows for the first direct calculation of the absolute electron transfer yield in a hybrid solar cell (82 ± 5\%). We also show that a limitation of the hybrid system is rapid and measurable geminate recombination due to the small separation of the initial charge pair. The fast recombination is consistent with the internal quantum efficiency of the corresponding solar cell. We therefore have identified and quantified a main loss mechanism in this type of third generation solar cell.},

abstract = {This paper describes a study of the rates of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from CdSe quantum dots (QDs) to poly(viologen) within thin films, as a function of the length of the ligands passivating the QDs. Ultrafast (<10 ps), quantitative PET occurs from CdSe QDs coated with HS-(CH(2))(n)-COOH for n = 1, 2, 5, and 7 to viologen units. The observed decrease in the magnitude of the PET rate constant with n is weaker than that expected from the decay of the electron tunneling probability across extended all-trans mercaptocarboxylic acids but well-described by electron tunneling across a collapsed ligand shell. The PET rate constants for films with n = 10 and 15 are much slower than those expected based on the trend for n = 1-7; this deviation is ascribed to the formation of bundles of ligands on the surface of the QD that make the tunneling process prohibitively slow by limiting access of the viologen units to the surfaces of the QDs. This study highlights the importance of molecular-level morphology of donor and acceptor materials in determining the rate and yield of interfacial photoinduced electron transfer in thin films.},

abstract = {Correlated, multielectron dynamics of "open" electronic systems within the fixed-nuclei approximation are treated here within explicitly time-dependent configuration-interaction schemes. Specifically, we present simulations of laser-pulse driven excitations of selected electronic states of LiCN in the presence of energy and phase relaxation. The evolution of the system is studied using open-system density matrix theory, which embeds naturally in the time-dependent configuration-interaction singles (doubles) formalism. Different models for dissipation based on the Lindblad semigroup formalism are presented. These models give rise to lifetimes for energy relaxation ranging from a few hundreds of femtoseconds to several nanoseconds. Pure dephasing is treated using a Kossakowski-like Gaussian model, proceeding on similar time scales. The pulse lengths employed range from very short (tens of femtoseconds) to very long (several nanoseconds). To make long-time propagations tractable, the quasiresonant approximation is used. The results show that despite the loss of efficiency, selective dipole switching can still be achieved in the presence of dissipation when using appropriately designed laser pulses.},

abstract = {MapReduce is a programming model and an associ- ated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. Many real world tasks are expressible in this model, as shown in the paper. Programs written in this functional style are automati- cally parallelized and executed on a large cluster of com- modity machines. The run-time system takes care of the details of partitioning the input data, scheduling the pro- gram’s execution across a set of machines, handling ma- chine failures, and managing the required inter-machine communication. This allows programmers without any experience with parallel and distributed systems to eas- ily utilize the resources of a large distributed system. Our implementation of MapReduce runs on a large cluster of commodity machines and is highly scalable: a typical MapReduce computation processes many ter- abytes of data on thousands of machines. Programmers find the system easy to use: hundreds of MapReduce pro- grams have been implemented and upwards of one thou- sand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google’s clusters every day. 1},

The time-dependent decay of the PA signal correlates with the recovery of the band gap absorption, indicating that the same carriers are involved. On this basis, we assign this PA signal to intraband absorption, that is, the excitation of photogenerated carriers from the bottom of the conduction band or the top of the valence band to higher energy levels in the conduction and valence band continuum. We confirm our experiments with tight-binding calculations. This broadband response in the commercially interesting near- to mid-infrared range is very relevant for ultra-high-speed all-optical signal processing. We benchmark the performance with bulk Si and Si nanocrystals.},

abstract = {A common strategy to calculate electronic coupling matrix elements for charge or energy transfer is to take the adiabatic states generated by electronic structure computations and rotate them to form localized diabatic states. In this paper, we show that, for intermolecular transfer of singlet electronic excitation, usually we cannot fully localize the electronic excitations in this way. Instead, we calculate putative initial and final states with small excitation tails caused by weak interactions with high energy excited states in the electronic manifold. These tails do not lead to substantial changes in the total diabatic coupling between states, but they do lead to a different partitioning of the total coupling between Coulomb (Fo ¨rster), exchange (Dexter), and one-electron components. The tails may be reduced by using a multistate diabatic model or eliminated entirely by truncation (denoted as “chopping”). Without more information, we are unable to conclude with certainty whether the observed diabatic tails are a physical reality or a computational artifact. This research suggests that decomposition of the diabatic coupling between chromophores into Coulomb, exchange, and one-electron components may depend strongly on the number of states considered, and such results should be treated with caution.},

abstract = {Thermal quenching of quantum dot (QD) luminescence is important for application in luminescent devices. Systematic studies of the quenching behavior above 300 K are, however, lacking. Here, high-temperature (300-500 K) luminescence studies are reported for highly efficient CdSe core-shell quantum dots (QDs), aimed at obtaining insight into temperature quenching of QD emission. Through thermal cycling (yoyo) experiments for QDs in polymer matrices, reversible and irreversible luminescence quenching processes can be distinguished. For a variety of core-shell systems, reversible quenching is observed in a similar temperature range, between 100 and 180 °C. The irreversible quenching behavior varies between different systems. Mechanisms for thermal quenching are discussed.},

abstract = {Time-resolved optical spectroscopy is widely used to study vibrational and electronic dynamics by monitoring transient changes in excited state populations on a femtosecond timescale. Yet the fundamental cause of electronic and vibrational dynamics--the coupling between the different energy levels involved--is usually inferred only indirectly. Two-dimensional femtosecond infrared spectroscopy based on the heterodyne detection of three-pulse photon echoes has recently allowed the direct mapping of vibrational couplings, yielding transient structural information. Here we extend the approach to the visible range and directly measure electronic couplings in a molecular complex, the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic light-harvesting protein. As in all photosynthetic systems, the conversion of light into chemical energy is driven by electronic couplings that ensure the efficient transport of energy from light-capturing antenna pigments to the reaction centre. We monitor this process as a function of time and frequency and show that excitation energy does not simply cascade stepwise down the energy ladder. We find instead distinct energy transport pathways that depend sensitively on the detailed spatial properties of the delocalized excited-state wavefunctions of the whole pigment-protein complex.},

abstract = {Nonadiabatic electron-transfer rates in intramolecular situations involving bridged structures intervening between donor and acceptor will generally be quite small in magnitude and will depend on the energetics of the transfer process, the chemical identity and nature of the donor, acceptor, and bridge species, the environment, and the temperature. We develop a self-contained perturbative method for the calculation of the electron-transfer matrix elements corresponding to intramolecular long-range electron transfer. This scheme is based on the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the effective scattering matrix. Iteration of this perturbation equation easily yields such well-known results as the McConnell formula for long-range superexchange interactions, the competition of through-bond and through-space coupling in bridge structures, the identification of superexchange, the relationship of superexchange process to exponential decay at long distance, and so forth. The scheme also permits direct calculation of the very small matrix elements involved in weak intramolecular electron-transfer coupling, even in situations with many competing bridges. The resulting perturbation theory formula for the effective matrix element is easily visualized, easily calculated even in extremely weak coupling situations, directly suggests the dominant pathway for electron transfer, and is within the realm of computational practicality even for large molecules.},

The resulting electronic couplings agree well with benchmark values for those exchange-correlation functionals that contain a high percentage of exact exchange.

Such states can be directly imaged using scanning tunneling microscopy, providing the extent and symmetry of the envelope wavefunctions. A detailed description of the effect of the tunneling geometry on the single-electron tunneling spectra is presented. Correlation of the optical and tunneling data allows for the assignment of the level spectrum.

However, their absorption bands provide limited coverage in the visible spectral range for light-harvesting applications. We report here the functionalization of porphyrin-based MOFs with CdSe/ZnS core/shell quantum dots (QDs) for the enhancement of light harvesting via energy transfer from the QDs to the MOFs. The broad absorption band of the QDs in the visible region offers greater coverage of the solar spectrum by QD-MOF hybrid structures. We show through time-resolved emission studies that photoexcitation of the QDs is followed by energy transfer to the MOFs with efficiencies of more than 80\%. This sensitization approach can result in a >50\% increase in the number of photons harvested by a single monolayer MOF structure with a monolayer of QDs on the surface of the MOF.},

abstract = {Diabatic states for donor (D) and acceptor (A) interactions in electron transfer (ET) processes are formulated and evaluated, along with coupling elements (H(DA)) and effective D/A separation distances (r(DA)), for reduced electronic spaces of variable size, using the generalized Mulliken Hush model (GMH), applicable to an arbitrary state space and nuclear configuration, and encompassing Robin-Day class III and as well as class II situations. Once the electronic state space is selected (a set of n ≥ 2 adiabatic states approximated by an orbital space based on an effective 1-electron (1-e) Hamiltonian), the charge-localized GMH diabatic states are obtained as the eigenstates of the dipole moment operator, with rotations to yield locally adiabatic states for sites with multiple states. The 1-e states and energies are expressed in terms of Kohn-Sham orbitals and orbital energies. Addressing questions as to whether the estimate of H(DA) "improves" as one increases n, and in what sense the GMH approach "converges" with n, we carry out calculations for three mixed-valence binuclear Ru complexes, from which we conclude that the 2-state (2-st) model gives the most appropriate estimate of the effective coupling, similar (to within a rms deviation of ≤15\%) to coupling elements obtained by superexchange correction of H(DA) values based on larger spaces (n = 3-6), and thus yielding a quasi-invariant value for H(DA) over the range explored in the calculations (n = 2-6). An analysis of the coupling and associated D and A states shows that the 2-st coupling involves crucial mixing with intervening bridge states (D and A "tails"), while increasingly larger state spaces for the same system yield increasingly more localized D and A states (and weaker coupling), with H(DA) tending to approach the limit of "bare" or "through space" coupling. These results help to reconcile seemingly contradictory assertions in the recent literature regarding the proper role of multistate frameworks in the formulation of coupling for both intra- and intermolecular ET systems.The present results are compared in detail with other reported results.},

abstract = {We present detailed investigations on the optical properties of PbSe nanocrystals. The absorption spectra of monodisperse, quasispherical nanocrystals exhibit sharp features as a result of distinct optical transitions. To study the size dependence, absorption spectra of nanocrystals ranging from 3.4 to 10.9 nm in diameter are analysed and a total of 11 distinct optical transitions are identified. The assignment of the various optical transitions is discussed and compared to theoretically calculated transition energies. By plotting all transitions as a function of nanocrystal size (D) we find that the energy (E) changes with the following relationship [Formula: see text] for the lowest energy transitions. The transition energy extrapolates to approximately 0.3 eV for infinite crystal size, in agreement with the bandgap of bulk PbSe at the L-point in the Brillouin zone. In addition, high-energy transitions are observed, which extrapolate to 1.6 eV for infinite crystal size, which is in good agreement with the bulk bandgap of PbSe at the Sigma-point in the Brillouin zone. Tight-binding calculations confirm that the high-energy transitions originate from the Sigma-point in the Brillouin zone. The Sigma-character of the high-energy transitions may be of importance to explain the mechanism behind multiple exciton generation in PbSe nanocrystals.},

From the known QD size distribution and its absorption spectrum, we used a theoretical model to calculate the dependence of InP QD bandgap on QD size.

Calculations of the equilibrium geometries and phonon modes are carried out using an empirical force field, and the electron and hole wave functions are calculated as particle-in-a-sphere envelope functions multiplying the Bloch functions, with valence-band mixing included for the hole functions. The coupling of each phonon mode to the 1S(e)-1S(3/2) and 1S(e)-2S(3/2) excitations is evaluated directly from the change in Coulombic energy along the phonon coordinate. Ten to 50 different modes in each crystal have significant Huang-Rhys factors, clustered around two frequency regions: acoustic phonons at 20-40 cm(-1) depending on crystal size, and optical phonons at 185-200 cm(-1). The Huang-Rhys factors are larger for the acoustic modes than for the optical modes and decrease with increasing crystal size, and the Huang-Rhys factors for each group of modes are smaller for the 1S(e)-2S(3/2) than for the 1S(e)-1S(3/2) excitation.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unhelpful sleep-related cognitions play an important role in insomnia and major depressive disorder, but their role in seasonal affective disorder has not yet been explored. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if individuals with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) have sleep-related cognitions similar to those with primary insomnia, and those with insomnia related to comorbid nonseasonal depression.

METHODS: Participants (n=147) completed the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep 16-item scale (DBAS-16) and the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorder Version (SIGH-SAD), which assesses self reported sleep problems including early, middle, or late insomnia, and hypersomnia in the previous week. All participants were assessed in winter, and during an episode for those with a depressive disorder.

RESULTS: Individuals with SAD were more likely to report hypersomnia on the SIGH-SAD, as well as a combined presentation of hypersomnia and insomnia on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The SAD group reported DBAS-16 scores in the range associated with clinical sleep disturbance, and DBAS-16 scores were most strongly associated with reports of early insomnia, suggesting circadian misalignment.

LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the self-report nature of the SIGH-SAD instrument on which insomnia and hypersomnia reports were based.

CONCLUSIONS: Future work could employ sleep- or chronobiological-focused interventions to improve clinical response in SAD.},

However, samples that scatter light intensely frustrate 2DES analysis, necessitating the use of isolated protein chromophore complexes when studying photosynthetic energy transfer processes. We present a method for conducting 2DES experiments that takes only seconds to acquire thousands of 2DES spectra and permits analysis of highly scattering samples, specifically whole cells of the purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. These in vivo 2DES experiments reveal similar time scales for energy transfer within the antennae complex (light harvesting complex 2, LH2) both in the native photosynthetic membrane environment and in isolated detergent micelles.

Singlet fission, its molecular analogue, may govern multi-exciton generation in a variety of materials, but a fundamental mechanism for singlet fission has yet to be described. Here, we use sophisticated ab initio calculations to show that singlet fission in pentacene proceeds through rapid internal conversion of the photoexcited state into a dark state of multi-exciton character that efficiently splits into two triplets. We show that singlet fission to produce a pair of triplet excitons must involve an intermediate state that (i) has a multi-exciton character, (ii) is energetically accessible from the optically allowed excited state, and (iii) efficiently dissociates into multiple electron-hole pairs. The rational design of photovoltaic materials that make use of singlet fission will require similar ab initio analysis of multi-exciton states such as the dark state studied here.},

Specific interactions with the surrounding protein environment often lead to significant changes in the excitation energies, but bulk dielectric effects can also play an important role. Moreover, strong excitonic interactions can occur in systems with several chromophores at close distances. For interpretation purposes, it is often desirable to distinguish different types of environ- mental effects, such as geometrical, electrostatic, polarization, and response (or differential polarization) effects. Methods that can be applied for theoretical analyses of such effects are re- viewed herein, ranging from continuum and point-charge models to explicit quantum chemical subsystem methods for environmental effects. Connections to physical model theories are also outlined. Prototypical applications to optical spectra and excited states of fluorescent proteins, biomolecular photo- receptors, and photosynthetic protein complexes are discussed.},

abstract = {The excited-state dynamics of two energy donor-bridge-acceptor (D-B-A) systems consisting of a zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnP) and a free base tetraphenylporphyrin (FbP) bridged by oligo-p-phenyleneethynylene units with different substituents has been investigated using ultrafast spectroscopy. These systems differ by the location of the lowest singlet excited state of the bridge, just above or below the S(2) porphyrin states. In the first case, Soret band excitation of the porphyrins is followed by internal conversion to the local S(1) state of both molecules and by a S(1) energy transfer from the ZnP to the FbP end on the 10 ns time scale, as expected for a center-to-center distance of about 4.7 nm. On the other hand, if the bridge is excited, the energy is efficiently transferred within 1 ps to both porphyrin ends. Selective bridge excitation is not possible with the second system, because of the overlap of the absorption bands. However, the time-resolved spectroscopic data suggest a reversible conversion between the D*(S(2))-B-A and D-B*(S(1))-A states as well as a transition from the D-B*(S(1))-A to the D-B-A* states on the picosecond time scale. This implies that the local S(2) energy of the ZnP end can be transported stepwise to the FbP end, i.e., over about 4.7 nm, within 1 ps with an efficiency of more than 0.2.},

abstract = {A general framework is presented to describe a resonant inelastic current inducing dynamics in the nuclear degrees of freedom of a molecule embedded between two electrodes. This approach makes use of the scattering theory of density matrices to account for the interaction between the scattering charge and the molecular modes to all orders and reduces in appropriate limits to both the standard master equation treatment for vibrational heating and the Landauer formalism for purely elastic transport. While the method presented here is equivalent to these approaches in limiting cases, it also goes well beyond their restrictions by incorporating the full quantum dynamics in the vibrational subspace in the presence of tunneling current. By application to the Au-C(60)-Au junction, it is shown that inclusion of vibrational coherences, which were previously neglected, is crucial to accurately predict the dynamics induced by current in molecular devices. Interaction with a bath of phonon modes is incorporated within the Bloch model and the competition between the bath-induced relaxation processes and the current-induced excitation is studied in detail over a range of temperatures.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm for computing explicitly correlated second- and third-order M\o ller–Plesset energies near the basis set limit for large molecules with a cost that scales formally as N4 with system size N. This is achieved through a hybrid approach where locality is exploited first through orbital specific virtuals (OSVs) and subsequently through pair natural orbitals (PNOs) and integrals are approximated using density fitting. Our method combines the low orbital transformation costs of the OSVs with the compactness of the PNO representation of the doubles amplitude vector. The N4 scaling does not rely upon the apriori definition of domains, enforced truncation of pair lists, or even screening and the energies converge smoothly to the canonical values with decreasing occupation number thresholds, used in the selection of the PNO basis. For MP2.5 intermolecular interaction energies,we find that 99\% of benchmark basis set limit correlation energy contributions are recovered using an aug-cc-pVTZ basis and that on average only 50 PNOs are required to correlate the significant orbital pairs.},

The exciton in the semiconductor domain can be quenched by electron-, hole-, and energy transfer to the metal particle, and the competition between these processes determines the photocatalytic efficiency of these materials. Using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, we show that, in CdS-Pt heterostructures consisting of a CdS nanorod with a Pt nanoparticle at one end, the excitons in the CdS domain dissociate by ultrafast electron transfer (with a half-life of ∼3.4 ps) to the Pt. The charge separated state is surprisingly long-lived (with a half-life of ∼1.2 ± 0.6 $\mu$s) due to the trapping of holes in CdS. The asymmetry in the charge separation and recombination times is believed to be the key feature that enables the accumulation of the transferred electrons in the Pt tip and photocatalysis in the presence of sacrificial hole acceptors.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To present an expert consensus, standardized, patient-informed sleep diary.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Sleep diaries from the original expert panel of 25 attendees of the Pittsburgh Assessment Conference(1) were collected and reviewed. A smaller subset of experts formed a committee and reviewed the compiled diaries. Items deemed essential were included in a Core sleep diary, and those deemed optional were retained for an expanded diary. Secondly, optional items would be available in other versions. A draft of the Core and optional versions along with a feedback questionnaire were sent to members of the Pittsburgh Assessment Conference. The feedback from the group was integrated and the diary drafts were subjected to 6 focus groups composed of good sleepers, people with insomnia, and people with sleep apnea. The data were summarized into themes and changes to the drafts were made in response to the focus groups. The resultant draft was evaluated by another focus group and subjected to lexile analyses. The lexile analyses suggested that the Core diary instructions are at a sixth-grade reading level and the Core diary was written at a third-grade reading level.

CONCLUSIONS: The Consensus Sleep Diary was the result of collaborations with insomnia experts and potential users. The adoption of a standard sleep diary for insomnia will facilitate comparisons across studies and advance the field. The proposed diary is intended as a living document which still needs to be tested, refined, and validated.},

The effect is observed as simultaneous increase in the population decay rate at the donor and of the rise time of optical emission at the acceptor sites. The hybrid configuration under investigation provides an alternative nonradiative, noncontact pumping route to electrical carrier injection that overcomes the losses imposed by the associated low carrier mobility of organic emitters.},

Catalysts that couple light energy into chemical reactions in a directed, orbital-specific manner would greatly reduce the energy input requirements of chemical transformations, revolutionizing catalysis-driven chemistry. Here we report the room temper- ature dissociation of H2 on gold nanoparticles using visible light. Surface plasmons excited in the Au nanoparticle decay into hot electrons with energies between the vacuum level and the work function of the metal. In this transient state, hot electrons can transfer into a Feshbach resonance of an H2 molecule adsorbed on the Au nanoparticle surface, triggering dissociation. We probe this process by detecting the formation of HD molecules from the dissociations of H2 and D2 and investigate the effect of Au nanoparticle size and wavelength of incident light on the rate of HD formation. This work opens a new pathway for controlling chemical reactions on metallic catalysts.},

In order to explore charge carrier dynamics dictated by the surface of the NC, femtosecond pump/probe spectroscopic experiments are performed on freshly synthesized and aged CdTe NCs. These experiments reveal fast electron trapping for aged CdTe NCs from the single excitonic state (X). Pump fluence dependence with excitonic state-resolved optical pumping enables directly populating the biexcitonic state (XX), which produces further accelerated electron trapping rates. This increase in electron trapping rate triggers coherent acoustic phonons by virtue of the ultrafast impulsive time scale of the surface trapping process. The observed trapping rates are discussed in terms of electron transfer theory.},

abstract = {Instances of strongly nonadiabatic electronic-vibrational energy transfer have been studied since the early days of quantum mechanics and remain a topic of fundamental interest. Often such transfers are associated with electronic resonances, temporary states where transient localization of charge on the molecule provides a mechanism for channeling electronic energy into vibrational excitation. Extensively studied in the gas phase, electron resonance scattering also occurs with surface adsorbed molecules, where it manifests itself in broadened cross sections and desorption of adsorbates from metal surfaces. In this Account, we focus on a related topic: the implications of nonadiabatic, resonance-mediated scattering to the exciting field of molecular electronics. In this context, researchers can induce directed nuclear dynamics and control these processes in single molecules in contact with metallic and semiconducting electrodes. We discuss a variety of consequences and applications of current-driven nuclear excitation in molecular devices, ranging from the design of new forms of molecular machines to surface chemistry at the single-molecule level and atom-resolved lithography. We highlight two specific examples of molecular nanomachines. In the first, a Au-C(60)-Au transistor, the current induces the oscillatory motion of the center-of-mass coordinate of the C(60). The second, a zwitterion-based rattle, demonstrates excitation of intramolecular motion as the positively charged moiety is threaded back and forth through the negatively charged carbon ring. Finally, we discuss the current-induced desorption of organic molecules from Si(100) both to suggest the potential for controlled surface nanochemistry and to develop guidelines for the design of stable molecular junctions. Modeling the exchange of energy between tunneling electrons and the vibrational degrees of freedom of a target molecule subject to bias voltage, open boundary conditions in the electronic subspace, and the dissipative effects of the electrodes poses a fascinating challenge to contemporary theories of inelastic electron transport. A scattering theory of density matrices is motivated by the need to address large amplitude, chemically relevant dynamics in tandem with an appropriate treatment of the electronic scattering problem. We provide a qualitative discussion of the theory and note the limits in which it reduces to well-known approaches.},

abstract = {The light absorption in light-harvesting complexes is performed by molecules such as chlorophyll, carotenoid, or bilin. Recent experimental findings in some of these complexes suggest the existence of long-lived coherences between the individual pigments at low temperatures. In this context, the question arises if the bath-induced fluctuations at different chromophores are spatially correlated or not. Here we investigate this question for the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex of Chlorobaculum tepidum by a combination of atomistic theories, i.e., classical molecular dynamics simulations and semiempirical quantum chemistry calculations. In these investigations at ambient temperatures, only weak correlations between the movements of the chromophores can be detected at the atomic level and none at the more coarse-grained level of site energies. The often-employed uncorrelated bath approximations indeed seem to be valid. Nevertheless, correlations between fluctuations in the electronic couplings between the pigments can be found. Depending on the level of theory employed, also correlations between the fluctuations of site energies and the fluctuations in electronic couplings are discernible.},

abstract = {Using a combination of transient photoluminescence and transient cathodoluminescence (trCL) we, for the first time, identify and quantify the distribution of electronic excitations in colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) under high-energy excitation. Specifically, we compare the temporally and spectrally resolved radiative recombination produced following excitation with 3.1 eV, subpicosecond photon pulses, or with ionizing radiation in the form of 20 keV picosecond electron pulses. Using this approach, we derive excitation branching ratios produced in the scenario of energetic excitation of NCs typical of X-ray, neutron, or gamma-ray detectors. Resultant trCL spectra and dynamics for CdSe NCs indicate that all observable emission can be attributed to recombination between states within the quantum-confined nanostructure with particularly significant yields of trions and multiexcitons produced by carrier multiplication. Our observations offer direct insight into the transduction of atomic excitation into quantum-confined states within NCs, explain that the root cause of poor performance in previous scintillation studies arises from efficient nonradiative Auger recombination, and suggest routes for improved detector materials.},

Although fabricating the semiconductor in a nanocrystalline morphology can slow this cooling, the transfer of hot carriers to electron and hole acceptors has not yet been thoroughly demonstrated. We used time-resolved optical second harmonic generation to observe hot-electron transfer from colloidal lead selenide (PbSe) nanocrystals to a titanium dioxide (TiO2) electron acceptor. With appropriate chemical treatment of the nanocrystal surface, this transfer occurred much faster than expected. Moreover, the electric field resulting from sub-50-femtosecond charge separation across the PbSe-TiO2 interface excited coherent vibrations of the TiO2 surface atoms, whose motions could be followed in real time.},

abstract = {We present a framework—validated using both modeling and experiment—to predict doping in CQD films. In the ionic semiconductors widely deployed in CQD films, the framework reduces to a simple accounting of the contributions of the oxidation state of each constituent, including both inorganic species and organic ligands. We use density functional theory simulations to confirm that the type of doping can be reliably predicted based on the overall stoichiometry of the CQDs, largely independent of microscopic geometrical bonding configurations. Studies employing field-effect transistors constructed from CQDs that have undergone various chemical treatments, coupled with Rutherford backscattering and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to provide compositional analysis, allow us to test and confirm the proposed model in an experimental framework. We investigate both p- and n-type electronic doping spanning a wide range of carrier concentrations from 1016 cm–3 to over 1018 cm–3, and demonstrate reversible switching between p- and n-type doping by changing the CQD stoichiometry. We show that the summation of the contributions from all cations and anions within the film can be used to predict accurately the majority carrier type. The findings enable predictable control over majority carrier concentration via tuning of the overall stoichiometry.},

(2007) Evidence for wavelike energy transfer through quantum coherence in photosynthetic systems. Nature 446:782-786]. In this paper, the spatial and temporal dynamics of EET through the FMO complex at physiological temperature are investigated theoretically. The numerical results reveal that quantum wave-like motion persists for several hundred femtoseconds even at physiological temperature, and suggest that the FMO complex may work as a rectifier for unidirectional energy flow from the peripheral light-harvesting antenna to the reaction center complex by taking advantage of quantum coherence and the energy landscape of pigments tuned by the protein scaffold. A potential role of quantum coherence is to overcome local energetic traps and aid efficient trapping of electronic energy by the pigments facing the reaction center complex.},

abstract = {Electron injection from a photoexcited chromophore into semiconductor (TiO2) nanoparticles is one of the key electron transfer processes in dye-sensitized solar cells. We describe our model for calculations of electron injection times, which is based on partitioning the semiconductor–chromophore system into fragments (TiO2 slab with adsorbed chromophore’s anchoring group, and an isolated chromophore), and calculating the imaginary part of the self-energy from the electronic properties of the fragments: density of states of TiO2 slab, TiO2–anchoring group coupling, and chromophore’s wave function coefficients. The electronic properties of the semiconductor and its interface with the chromophore’s anchoring group are reused for all chromophores with the same anchoring group (carboxylic acid in this study), and only a calculation of the isolated chromophore’s lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is required for each chromophore. We use this model to calculate electron injection times for a large set of organic chromophores, including, e.g., perylene dyes and biisonicotinic acid, on TiO2 rutile (110) and anatase (101) surfaces. The calculated injection times are in good agreement with reported experimental injection times or light conversion efficiencies of solar cells based on these dyes. Our model is computationally efficient and allows us to make reliable predictions of electron injection times for families of chromophores sharing the same adsorption chemistry.},

@article{Pearson1975,
abstract = {Jahn-Teller effects are grouped into two categories. The first arises from incomplete shells of degenerate orbitals. It includes the first-order Jahn-Teller effect, and the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect. The second arises from filled and empty molecular orbitals that are close in energy, and is the second-order Jahn-Teller effect. The two categories have quite different physical bases. As a result, geometric distortions produced by the first are quite small and normally lead to dynamic effects only. In favorable cases, the second-order Jahn-Teller effect produces very large distortions, including complete dissociation of a molecule. This can occur even when the relevant molecular orbitals are separated in energy by as much as 4 eV.},

@article{Thomas2013,
abstract = {We present a novel implementation for the calculation of vibrational spectra from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. In particular, we show mass-weighted power spectra, infrared spectra, and Raman spectra with corresponding depolarization ratios, which are based on time-correlation functions of velocities, dipole moments, and polarizabilities, respectively. Using the four organic molecules methanol, acetone, nitromethane, and pinacol as test systems, we compare the spectra from AIMD simulations of the isolated molecules in gas phase to static calculations relying on the harmonic approximation and to experimental spectra recorded in a nonpolar solvent. The AIMD approach turns out to give superior results when anharmonicity effects are of particular importance. Using the example of methanol, we demonstrate the application to bulk phase systems, which are not directly accessible by static calculations, but for which the AIMD spectra also provide a very good approximation to experimental data. Finally, we investigate the temperature influence in the AIMD simulation on the resulting spectra.},

@article{Alavi2000,
abstract = {A theoretical study of tip-induced desorption of benzene from a Si?100? surface is presented. The energetically forbidden process is triggered by inelastic resonance tunneling mediated by a cationic state of the substrate–adsorbate complex. Potential energy surfaces for the neutral and ionic states are computed within a cluster model. Quantum mechanical time-dependent wave packet calculations are used to explore the desorption dynamics. Extension of the scheme to study the response of different classes of organic adsorbates to tunneling current and to control of other surface reactions with a scanning tunneling microscope is discussed.},

abstract = {We present a model for strong field coherent control of torsional modes of molecules with a focus on exploring the controllability of molecular torsions subject to dissipative media and understanding how phase information is exchanged between torsional modes and a dissipative environment. Our theory is based on a density matrix formalism, wherein dissipation is accounted for within a multilevel Bloch equation model. Our results point to new and interesting phenomena in wavepacket dissipation dynamics that are unique to torsions and also enrich our general understanding of wavepacket phenomena. In addition, we suggest guidelines for designing torsional control experiments for molecules interacting with a dissipative bath.},
