bibtextract
===========

Use this script to prepare a .bib file containing all the references used in a .tex document.
The references are scraped from a large .bib file containing many irrelevant references.

Usage:

bibtexctract.py <old .bib file> <.tex file> <new .bib file>

There is currently no error checking for anything like missing citations or bad formatting--that is left to the author.
